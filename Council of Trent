THE BULL OF INDICTION 
OF THE SACRED OECUMENICAL AND GENERAL COUNCIL OF 
TRENT 
UNDER THE SOVEREIGN PONTIFF, PAUL III 
PAUL, bishop, servant of the servants of God, for the future memory hereof. 
At the beginning of this our pontificate,--which, not for any merits of our 
own, but of its own great goodness, the providence of Almighty God hath 
committed unto us,--already perceiving unto what troubled times, and unto 
how many embarrassments in almost all our affairs, our pastoral solicitude 
and watchfulness were called; we would fain indeed have remedied the evils 
wherewith the Christian commonweal had been long afflicted, and well-nigh 
overwhelmed; but we too, as men compassed with infirmity, felt our strength 
unequal to take upon us so heavy a burthen. For, whereas we saw that peace 
was needful to free and preserve the commonweal from the many impending 
dangers, we found all replete with enmities and dissensions; and, above all, 
the (two) princes, to whom God has entrusted well-nigh the whole direction 
of events, at enmity with each other. Whereas we deemed it necessary that 
there should be one fold and one shepherd, for the Lord's flock in order to 
[Page 2] maintain the Christian religion in its integrity, and to confirm within 
us the hope of heavenly things; the unity of the Christian name was rent and 
well-nigh torn asunder by schisms, dissensions, heresies. Whereas we could 
have wished to see the commonwealth safe and guarded against the arms and 
insidious designs of the Infidels, yet, through our transgressions and the guilt 
of us all,--the wrath of God assuredly hanging over our sins,--Rhodes had 
been lost; Hungary ravaged; war both by land and sea had been contemplated 
and planned against Italy, Austria, and Illyria; whilst our impious and ruthless 
enemy the Turk was never at rest, and looked upon our mutual enmities and 
dissensions as his fitting opportunity for carrying out his designs with 
success. Wherefore, having been, as we have said, called upon to guide and 
govern the bark of Peter, in so great a tempest, and in the midst of so violent 
an agitation of the waves of heresies, dissensions, and wars; and, not relying 
sufficiently on our own strength, we, first of all, cast our cares upon the Lord, 
that He might sustain us, and furnish our soul with firmness and strength, our 
understanding with prudence and wisdom. Then, recalling to mind that our 
predecessors, men endowed with admirable wisdom and sanctity, had often, 
in the extremest perils of the Christian commonweal, had recourse to 
ecumenical councils and general assemblies of bishops, as the best and most 
opportune remedy, we also fixed our mind on holding a general council; and 
having consulted the opinions of those princes whose consent seemed to us to 
be specially useful and opportune for this our project; when we found them, 
at that time, not averse from so holy a work, we, as our letters and records 
attest, indicted an ecumenical council, and a general assembly of those 
bishops and other Fathers whose duty it is to assist thereat, to be opened at the 
city of Mantua, on the tenth of the calends of June, in the year 1537 of our 
Lord's Incarnation, and the third of our pontificate; having an almost assured 
hope that, when assembled there in the name of the Lord, He, as He 
promised, would be in the midst of us, and, in His goodness and mercy, easily 
dispel, by the breath of His [Page 3] mouth, all the storms and dangers of the 
times. But,--as the enemy of mankind ever sets his snares against holy 
enterprises, --at the very outset, contrary to all our hopes and expectations, the 
city of Mantua was refused us, unless we would submit to certain conditions,-
as described in other letters of ours,--which conditions were utterly alien to 
the institutes of our predecessors, to the state of the times, to our own dignity 
and liberty, that of this holy see, and of the ecclesiastical character. We were, 
therefore, necessitated to find another place, and to make choice of some 
other city ; andwhereas one fit and suitable did not immediately present itself, 
we were obliged to prorogue the celebration of the council unto the ensuing 
calends of November. Meanwhile the Turk, our cruel and perpetual enemy, 
attacked Italy with a vast fleet; took, sacked, ravaged several cities of Apulia, 
and carried off numbers into captivity; whilst we, in the midst of the greatest 
alarm, and the general danger, were engaged in fortifying our shores, and in 
furnishing assistance to the neighbouring states. But not therefore did we 
meanwhile cease to consult with the Christian princes, and to exhort them to 
inform us, what, in their opinion, would be a suitable place wherein to hold 
the council: and whereas their opinions were various and wavering, and there 
seemed to be needless delay, we, with the best intentions, and, as we also 
think, with the most judicious prudence, fixed on Vicenza, a wealthy city 
granted to us by the Venetians, and which, by their valour, authority, and 
power, offered in a special manner both unobstructed access, and a safe and 
free place of residence for all. But, as too much of the time appointed had 
already passed away; and it was necessary to signify to all the fresh city that 
had been chosen; and, whereas the approaching calends of November 
precluded our having the opportunity of making the announcement of this 
change public, and winter was now near; we were again constrained to defer, 
by another prorogation, the time for opening the Council, to the next ensuing 
Spring, that is, to the next calends of May. This having been firmly resolved 
upon and decreed; considering,--whilst preparing ourselves, and [Page 4] 
arranging all other matters for conducting and celebrating that assembly in a 
proper manner under the divine assistance,--that it was a point of great 
importance, both as regards the celebration of the Council, and the general 
weal of Christendom, that the Christian princes should be united together in 
peace and concord; We ceased not to implore and conjure our most beloved 
sons in Christ, Charles, ever August, the emperor of the Romans, and Francis, 
the most Christian king, the two main supports and stays of the Christian 
name, to meet together for a conference between them and us; and, with both 
of them, by letters, Nuncios, and our Legates a latere selected from amongst 
our venerable brethren, did we very often strive to move them to lay aside 
their jealousies and animosities; to unite in strict alliance and holy friendship; 
and to succour the tottering cause of Christendom: for as it was to preserve 
this especially, that God had bestowed on them their power, if they neglected 
to do this, and directed not all their counsels to the common weal of 
Christians, a bitter and severe account would they have to render unto Him. 
They, yielding at last to our prayers, repaired to Nice; whither we also, for the 
cause of God and to bring about peace, undertook a long journey, though 
sorely unsuited to our advanced age. Meanwhile, as the time fixed for the 
Council,--the calends to wit of May,--drew nigh, we did not neglect to send to 
Vicenza three Legates a latere,--men of the greatest virtue and authority, 
chosen from the number of our own brethren, the cardinals of the holy Roman 
Church,--to open the Council; to receive the prelates as they arrived from 
various parts; and to transact and attend to such matters as they should deem 
necessary, until we, on our return from our journey and message of peace, 
should be able ourselves to direct everything with greater precision. We, in 
the mean time, applied ourselves to that holy and most necessary work, the 
negotiation of peace; and this with all the zeal, the affection, and the 
earnestness of our soul. God is our witness, on whose clemency we relied, 
when we exposed ourselves to the dangers of that journey at the peril of our 
life: our conscience is our witness, which herein, at least, cannot reproach us 
with having either neglected, or not sought for, an opportunity of effecting a 
reconciliation: the [Page 5] princes themselves are our witnesses, whom we 
so often and so earnestly conjured by our Nuncios, letters, legates, 
admonitions, exhortations, and by all kinds of entreaties, to lay aside their 
jealousies, to unite in alliance, and with combined zeal and forces to succour 
the Christian commonweal, which was now reduced to the greatest and most 
urgent danger. And witnesses too are those watchings and cares, those labours 
of our soul both by day and night, and those grievous solicitudes, which we 
have already endured to such an extent in this business and cause; and yet our 
councils and acts have not as yet brought about the wished-for result. For so 
hath it seemed good to the Lord our God, who, however, we still hope will 
cast a more favourable eye on our wishes. For ourselves, we, as far as in us 
lay, have not, indeed, herein omitted anything that was due from our pastoral 
office. And if there be any who interpret in any other sense our endeavours 
after peace, we are indeed grieved; but, in our grief, we return thanks to that 
Almighty God, who, as a pattern and a lesson of patience unto us, willed that 
His own apostles should be accounted worthy to suffer reproach for the name 
of Jesus who is our peace. However, in that our meeting and conference at 
Nice, though, by reason of our sins, a true and lasting peace could not be 
concluded between the two princes, yet was a truce for ten years agreed upon; 
under favour of which having our hopes, that both the sacred council might 
be celebrated more commodiously, and further that peace might be perfectly 
established by the authority of the council, we were urgent with those princes 
to come themselves to the council, to bring with them those of their prelates 
who accompanied them, and to summon the absent. They having excused 
themselves upon both these points,--for that it was at that time, necessary for 
them to return to their kingdoms, and that the prelates whom they had with 
them, being wearied and exhausted by the journey and its expenses, must 
needs refresh and recruit themselves,--exhorted us to decree yet another 
prorogation of the time for opening the council. And whereas we had some 
difficulty to yield herein, in the interim we received letters from our legates 
[Page 6] at Vicenza, announcing that, although the day for opening the 
council had arrived, nay had long since passed by, barely one or two prelates 
had repaired to Vicenza from any of the foreign nations. Upon receiving this 
information, seeing that the council could not, under any circumstances, be 
held at that time, we accorded to the said princes, that the time for celebrating 
the council should be deferred till next holy Easter, the feast of the 
Resurrection of the Lord. Of which our ordinance and prorogation, the 
decretal letters were given and published at Genoa, in the year of the 
Incarnation of our Lord, MDXXXVIII, on the fourth of the calends of July. 
And this delay we granted the more readily, because each of the princes 
promised us to send an ambassador to us at Rome; in order that those things 
which were necessary for the perfect re-establishment of peace,--all of which 
could not, on account of the shortness of the time, be completed at Nice,-
might be treated of and negotiated more conveniently at Rome in our 
presence. And for this reason also, they both begged of us, that the 
negotiation of peace might precede the celebration of the council; for that, 
peace once established, the council itself would then be much more useful 
and salutary to the Christian commonweal. It was, indeed, this hope of peace, 
thus held out to us, that ever moved us to assent to the wishes of those 
princes; a hope which was greatly increased by the kindly and friendly 
interview between those two princes after our departure from Nice; the news 
of which was to us a source of very great joy, and so confirmed us in our 
good hope, that we believed that God, at length, had hearkened to our prayers, 
and had graciously received our earnest wishes for peace. The conclusion, 
then, of this peace was both desired and urged; and as it was the opinion not 
only of the two princes aforenamed, but also of our most dear son in Christ, 
Ferdinand, King of the Romans, that the business of the council ought not to 
be entered upon until after peace had been established; whilst all the parties 
urged upon us, by letters and their ambassadors, again to appoint a further 
prorogation of the time; and the most serene emperor was especially urgent, 
representing that he had promised those who dissent from Catholic unity, that 
he would interpose his mediation with us, to the end that some plan of [Page 
7] concord might be devised, which could not be accomplished satisfactorily 
before his return to Germany: impelled throughout by the same desire of 
peace, and by the wishes of so mighty princes, and, above all, seeing that not 
even on the said feast of the Resurrection had any other prelates assembled at 
Vicenza, we, now avoiding the word prorogation, so often repeated in vain, 
chose rather to suspend the celebration of the general council during our own 
good pleasure, and that of the Apostolic See. We accordingly did so, and 
despatched our letters touching such suspension to each of the above-named 
princes, on the tenth day of June, MDXXXIX, as from the tenor thereof may 
be clearly seen. This necessary suspension, then, having been made by us, 
whilst we were looking forward to that more suitable time, and to that 
conclusion of peace which was later to bring both dignity and numbers to the 
council, and more immediate safety to the Christian commonweal; the affairs 
of Christendom meanwhile fell day by day into a worse state. The 
Hungarians, upon the death of their king, had invited the Turk; King 
Ferdinand had declared war against them; a part of Belgium had been incited 
to revolt against the most serene emperor, who, to crush that rebellion, 
traversed France on the most friendly and harmonious terms with the most 
Christian king, and with great show of mutual good will towards each other; 
and, having reached Belgium, thence passed into Germany, where he 
commenced holding diets of the princes and cities of Germany, with the view 
of treating of that concord of which he had spoken to us. But as there was 
now no longer scarcely any hope of peace, and the scheme of procuring and 
treating of a re-union in those diets seemed only adapted to excite greater 
discord, we were led to revert to our former remedy, a general council; and, 
by our legates, cardinals of the holy Roman Church, we proposed this to the 
emperor himself; and this we did especially and finally in the diet of 
Ratisbon, at which our beloved son, Cardinal Gaspar Contarini, of the title of 
St. Praxedes, acted as our legate with very great learning and integrity. For, 
whereas what we had previously feared now come to pass,--that by the advice 
of that diet we were called upon to declare that certain of the articles, 
maintained by the dissenters from the Church, were to be tolerated until they 
should be examined and decided upon [Page 8] by an ecumenical council; 
and whereas neither Christian and Catholic truth, nor our own dignity and that 
of the Apostolic See, would suffer us to yield this,---we chose rather to 
command that a proposal should be openly made, that a council should be 
held as soon as possible. Nor, indeed, had we ever any other sentiment or 
wish, but that an ecumenical and general council should be convened on the 
very first opportunity. For we hoped that both peace might thereby be 
restored to the Christian people, and to the Christian religion its integrity; yet 
were we wishful to hold that council with the good wishes and favour of the 
Christian princes. And whilst looking forward to those good wishes, whilst 
watching for that hidden time, for the time of thy good pleasure, 0 God, we 
were at last forced to the conclusion, that every time is well pleasing unto 
God wherein deliberations are entered upon touching holy things, and such as 
relate to Christian piety. Wherefore, upon beholding with the bitterest grief of 
soul, that the affairs of Christendom were daily hurrying on to a worse state; 
Hungary overwhelmed by the Turk; Germany endangered; all the other states 
oppressed with terror and affliction; we resolved to wait no longer for the 
consent of any prince, but to look solely to the will of God, and the good of 
the Christian commonweal. Accordingly, as we no longer had the city of 
Vicenza, and were desirous, in our choice of a fresh place for holding the 
council, to have regard both to the common welfare of Christians, and also to 
the troubles of the German nation; and seeing, upon several places being 
proposed, that they (the Germans) wished for the city of Trent, we,---though 
of opinion that every thing might be transacted more commodiously in 
Cisalpine Italy,---nevertheless yielded up our will, with paternal charity, to 
their demands. Accordingly, we have chosen the city of Trent as that wherein 
an ecumenical council is to be held on the ensuing calends of November: 
fixing upon that place as a convenient one whereat the bishops and prelates 
can assemble very easily indeed from Germany, and from the other nations 
bordering on Germany, and without difficulty from France, Spain, and the 
other remoter provinces. And in fixing [Page 9] the day for the council, we 
have had regard that there should be time both for publishing this our decree 
throughout the Christian nations, and for allowing all prelates an opportunity 
of repairing to Trent. Our motive for not prescribing that a whole year should 
expire before changing the place of the council,--as by certain constitutions 
has been aforetime regulated,---was this, that we were unwilling that our hope 
should be any longer delayed of applying some remedy to the Christian 
commonwealth, suffering as it is under so many disasters and calamities. And 
yet we observe the times; we acknowledge the difficulties. We know that 
what may be looked for from our councils is a matter of uncertainty. But, 
seeing that it is written, commit thy way to the Lord, and trust in him, and he 
will do it, we have resolved rather to trust in the clemency and mercy of God, 
than to distrust our own weakness. For, upon engaging in good works, it often 
happens, that what human councils fail in, the divine power accomplishes. 
Wherefore, relying and resting on the authority of that Almighty God, Father, 
and Son, and Holy Ghost, and on the authority of His blessed apostles, Peter 
and Paul, (an authority) which we also exercise on earth; with the advice also 
and assent of our venerable brethren, the cardinals of the holy Roman Church; 
after having removed and annulled, as by these presents we do remove and 
annul, the suspension aforenamed, we indict, announce, convoke, appoint, 
and decree a sacred, ecumenical and general council,--to be opened on the 
ensuing calends of November of the present year, MDXLII, from the 
Incarnation of the Lord,--in the city of Trent, a place commodious, free, and 
convenient for all nations; and to be there prosecuted, concluded, and 
completed, with God's help, to His glory and praise, and the welfare of the 
whole Christian people; requiring, exhorting, admonishing all, of every 
country, as well our venerable brethren the patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, 
and our beloved sons the abbots, as also all others soever, unto whom, by 
right or privilege, the power has been granted of sitting in general councils, 
and of delivering their sentiments therein; enjoining moreover, and strictly 
command- [Page 10] ing them, by virtue of the oath which they have taken to 
us and to this holy See, and in virtue of holy obedience, and under the other 
pains, which, by law or custom, are usually passed and proposed in the 
celebration of councils, against those who do not attend, that they are, 
undoubtedly to repair to and to be present themselves in person at this sacred 
council--unless they shall happen to be hindered by some just impediment, of 
which, however, they shall be obliged to furnish proof--or at all events by 
their own lawful deputies and proctors. And we also beseech the aforenamed 
emperor, and the most Christian king, as also the other kings, dukes, and 
princes, whose presence, now if ever, would be of especial advantage to the 
most holy faith of Christ, and of all Christians; conjuring them by the bowels 
of the mercy of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ,--the truth of whose faith, 
and whose religion are now so sorely assailed both from within and without,-
that, if they would have the Christian commonweal safe, if they feel 
themselves bound and obliged, by the Lord's great benefits towards them, 
they abandon not His own cause and interests; and come themselves to the 
celebration of the sacred council, where their piety and virtue would be 
greatly conducive to the common good, to their own welfare, and that of 
others, both in time and eternity. But if, which we hope may not be the case, 
they shall be unable to come in person, let them at least send, with an 
authoritative commission, as their ambassadors, men of weight, who may 
each in the council represent the person of his prince with prudence and 
dignity. But above all, let this--which is a thing very easy on their parts--be 
their care, that, from their respective kingdoms and provinces, the bishops 
and prelates set forth without tergiversation and delay; a request which God 
Himself, and we, have a right to obtain from the prelates and princes of 
Germany in a special manner; for as it is principally on their account, and at 
their instance, that the council has been indicted and convoked, and in the 
very city which they desired, let them not think it burthensome to celebrate 
and adorn it with the presence of their whole body. That [Page 11] thus,--with 
God going before us in our deliberations, and holding before our minds the 
light of His own wisdom and truth,--we may, in the said sacred ecumenical 
council, in a better and more com-modious manner, treat of, and, with the 
charity of all conspiring to one end, deliberate and discuss, execute and bring 
to the desired issue, speedily and happily, whatsoever appertains to the 
integrity and truth of the Christian religion; the restoration of good and the 
correction of evil manners; the peace, unity, and concord both of Christian 
princes and peoples; and whatsoever is needful for repelling those assaults of 
barbarians and infidels, with which they seek the overthrow of all 
Christendom. And that this our letter, and the contents thereof, may come to 
the knowledge of all whom it concerns, and that no one may plead as an 
excuse ignorance thereof, especially also as there may not perhaps be free 
access to all, unto whom our letter ought to be individually communicated; 
we will and ordain, that in the Vatican Basilica of the prince of the apostles, 
and in the Lateran Church, at the time when the multitude of the people is 
wont to assemble there to hear the divine service, it be publicly read in a loud 
voice by officers of our court, or by certain public notaries; and, after having 
been read, be affixed to the doors of the said churches, also to the gates of the 
apostolic Chancery, and to the usual place in the Campo di Fiore, where it 
shall for some time hang exposed to be read and seen by all; and, when 
removed thence, copies thereof shall still remain affixed in the same places. 
For we will that, by being thus read, published, and affixed, the letter 
aforesaid shall oblige and bind, after the interval of two months from the day 
of being published and affixed, all and each of those whom it includes, even 
as if it had been communicated and read to them in person. And we ordain 
and decree, that an unhesitating and undoubting faith be given to copies 
thereof written, or subscribed, by the hand of a public notary, and guaranteed 
by the seal of some ecclesiastic constituted in authority. Wherefore, let no one 
infringe this our letter of indiction, announcement, convocation, statute, 
decree, mandate, precept, and prayer, or [Page 12] with rash daring go 
contrary thereunto. But if any one shall presume to attempt this, let him know 
that he will incur the indignation of Almighty God, and of His blessed 
apostles Peter and Paul. Given at Rome, at Saint Peter's, in the year MDXLII 
of the Lord's Incarnation, on the eleventh of the calends of June, in the eighth 
year of our pontificate.

James, that Every best gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the 
father of lights, who, to those who ask of him wisdom, giveth to all abundantly, and 
upbraideth them not; and knowing withal that The fear of the Lord is the beginning of 
wisdom, hath ordained and decreed, that all and each of the faithful of Christ, assembled 
in the city of Trent, be exhorted, as they are hereby exhorted, to amend themselves of 
their evils and sins heretofore committed, and to walk henceforth in the fear of the Lord; 
not to fulfil the lusts of the flesh; to be instant in prayer; to confess more frequently; to 
receive the sacrament of the Eucharist; to visit churches; to fulfil, in fine, as far as each 
one shall be able, the commandments of the Lord; and, furthermore, to pray daily in 
private for peace between Christian princes, and for the unity of the Church: and as 
regards the bishops, and all others soever constituted in the priestly order, who are 
celebrating together an ecumenical council in this city, that they give heed to apply 
themselves assiduously to the praises [Page 14] of God; to offer up victims, praises, and 
prayers; to celebrate the sacrifice of the mass on each Sunday at least, the day whereon 
God made the light, rose again from the dead, and poured forth the Holy Ghost upon the 
disciples; making, as the same Holy Ghost enjoins by the apostle, supplications, prayers, 
intercessions, thanksgiving, for our most holy lord the Pope, for the emperor, for kings, 
and others who are placed in high stations, and for all men, that we may lead a quiet and 
peaceable life, may enjoy peace, and see an increase of faith. Furthermore, it exhorts that 
they fast at least on every Friday, in memory of the passion of the Lord, and give alms to 
the poor: further, on every Thursday there shall be celebrated, in the cathedral church, the 
mass of the Holy Ghost, with the litanies and other prayers appointed for this end; and on 
the same day there shall be said, in the other churches, at least the litanies and prayers; 
and during the time that the sacred services are being performed, let there be no talking or 
conversing together, but with mouth and mind association with the celebrant. And 
forasmuch as It behoveth bishops to be blameless, sober, chaste, ruling well their own 
household, (the Council) exhorts also that, above all, each observe sobriety at table, and 
moderation in diet; further, that, whereas idle conversations are often wont to arise there, 
the reading of the divine Scriptures be introduced, even at the tables of bishops; and let 
each teach and charge his servants not to be quarrelsome, given to wine, immodest, 
covetous, proud, blasphemous, and lovers of pleasures; in fine, let them shun vice and 
follow after virtue, and in dress, demeanour, and in all their actions show forth modesty, 
as becomes the servants of the servants of God. 
Moreover, whereas it is the chief care, solicitude, and intention of this sacred and holy 
council, that, the darkness of heresies, which during so many years has covered the earth, 
being dispelled, the light, brightness, and purity of Catholic truth may, by the assistance 
of Jesus Christ, who is the true light, shine forth; and that those things which need 
reformation may be reformed; the said Synod exhorts all Catholics here assembled, [Page 
15] and to be assembled, and especially those skilled in sacred letters, that by sedulous 
meditation they ponder diligently within themselves, by what ways and means the 
intention of the Synod may be best carried out and obtain the desired effect; that, in the 
most prompt and prudent manner, the things to be condemned, may be condemned; and 
those to be approved of be approved; that so, throughout the whole world, all may, with 
one mouth, and with the same confession of faith, glorify God, and the Father of our Lord 
Jesus Christ. 
And in delivering their sentiments, when the priests of the Lord are sitting together in the 
place of benediction, no one--agreeably to the statute of the council of Toledo--ought 
either to be boisterous by immoderate outcries, or to cause disturbance by tumult; none to 
be contentious with false, vain, or obstinate disputation; but let whatsoever is said be so 
tempered by the mildest utterance of the words spoken, that neither the hearers may be 
offended, nor the rectitude of a correct judgment be warped by the mind being troubled. 
Furthermore, this sacred Synod has ordained and decreed, that if it should chance to 
happen that any do not sit in their due places, and (thus) deliver their sentiments, even 
under the word Placet, (It pleaseth us,) are present at the Congregations, and take part in 
any other act whatsoever during the council, none shall thereby be prejudiced, none 
acquire a new right.

SESSION THE THIRD,
 Celebrated on the fourth day of the month of February, in the year 1546. 
DECREE TOUCHING THE SYMBOL OF FAITH
 In the Name of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost. 
This sacred and holy, ecumenical, and general Synod of [Page 16] Trent,--lawfully 
assembled in the Holy Ghost, the same three legates of the Apostolic See presiding 
therein,--considering the magnitude of the matters to be treated of, especially of those 
comprised under the two heads, of the extirpating of heresies, and the reforming of 
manners, for the sake of which chiefly It is assembled, and recognizing with the apostles, 
that Its wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the spirits of wickedness in the 
high places, exhorts, with the same apostle, all and each above all things, to be 
strengthened in the Lord, and in the might of his power, in all things taking the shield of 
faith, wherewith they may be able to extinguish all the fiery darts of the most wicked one, 
and to take the helmet of salvation, with the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God. 
Wherefore, that this its pious solicitude may begin and proceed by the grace of God, It 
ordains and decrees that, before all other things, a confession of faith is to be set forth; 
following herein the examples of the Fathers, who have been wont, in the most sacred 
coucils, at the beginning of the Actions thereof, to oppose this shield against heresies; and 
with this alone, at times, have they drawn the unbelieving to the faith, overthrown 
heretics, and confirmed the faithful. For which cause, this council has thought good, that 
the Symbol of faith which the holy Roman Church makes use of,--as being that principle 
wherein all who profess the faith of Christ necessarily agree, and that firm and alone 
foundation against which the gates of hell shall never prevail,--be expressed in the very 
same words in which it is read in all the churches. Which Symbol is as follows: I believe 
in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and 
invisible; and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, and born of the 
Father before all ages; God of God, light of light, true God of true God; begotten, not 
made, consubstantial with the Father, by whom all things were made: who for us men, 
and for our salvation, came down from the heavens, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost 
of [Page 17] the Virgin Mary, and was made man: crucified also for us under Pontius 
Pilate, he suffered and was buried; and he rose again on the third day, according to the 
Scriptures; and he ascended into heaven, sitteth at the right hand of the Father ; and again 
he will come with glory to judge the living and the dead; of whose kingdom there shall be 
no end: and in the Holy Ghost the Lord, and the giver of life, who proceedeth from the 
Father and the Son; who with the Father and the Son together is adored and glorified; who 
spoke by the prophets and one holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. I confess one baptism 
for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the 
world to come. Amen. 
INDICTION OF THE NEXT SESSION 
The same sacred and holy, ecumenical, and general Synod of Trent,--lawfully assembled 
in the Holy Ghost, the same three legates of the Apostolic See presiding therein, -- 
understanding that many prelates in divers places are girt for their journey, and that some 
also are on their way hither; and considering that all that may be decreed by the said 
sacred Synod may seem to be in so much the greater estimation and honour with all men, 
as it shall have been sanctioned and confirmed by a more numerous and fuller council and 
attendance of Fathers, has resolved and decreed, that the next Session after the present be 
celebrated on the Thursday after Laetare Sunday next; but that, in the interim, the 
discussion and examination of those things which it shall seem fit to the said Synod to 
discuss and examine be not deferred.

[Page 17] 
SESSION THE FOURTH 
Celebrated on the eighth day of the month of April, in the year MDXLVI. 
DECREE CONCERNING THE CANONICAL SCRIPTURES 
The sacred and holy, ecumenical, and general Synod of Trent,--lawfully assembled in the 
Holy Ghost, the Same three legates of the Apostolic Sec presiding therein,--keeping this 
[Page 18] always in view, that, errors being removed, the purity itself of the Gospel be 
preserved in the Church; which (Gospel), before promised through the prophets in the 
holy Scriptures, our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, first promulgated with His own 
mouth, and then commanded to be preached by His Apostles to every creature, as the 
fountain of all, both saving truth, and moral discipline; and seeing clearly that this truth 
and discipline are contained in the written books, and the unwritten traditions which, 
received by the Apostles from the mouth of Christ himself, or from the Apostles 
themselves, the Holy Ghost dictating, have come down even unto us, transmitted as it 
were from hand to hand; (the Synod) following the examples of the orthodox Fathers, 
receives and venerates with an equal affection of piety, and reverence, all the books both 
of the Old and of the New Testament--seeing that one God is the author of both --as also 
the said traditions, as well those appertaining to faith as to morals, as having been 
dictated, either by Christ's own word of mouth, or by the Holy Ghost, and preserved in the 
Catholic Church by a continuous succession. And it has thought it meet that a list of the 
sacred books be inserted in this decree, lest a doubt may arise in any one's mind, which 
are the books that are received by this Synod. They are as set down here below: of the Old 
Testament: the five books of Moses, to wit, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, 
Deuteronomy; Josue, Judges, Ruth, four books of Kings, two of Paralipomenon, the first 
book of Esdras, and the second which is entitled Nehemias; Tobias, Judith, Esther, Job, 
the Davidical Psalter, consisting of a hundred and fifty psalms; the Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, 
the Canticle of Canticles, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Isaias, Jeremias, with Baruch; 
Ezechiel, Daniel; the twelve minor prophets, to wit, Osee, Joel, Amos, Abdias, Jonas, 
Micheas, Nahum, Habacuc, Sophonias, Aggaeus, Zacharias, Malachias; two books of the 
Machabees, the first and the second. Of the New Testament: the four Gospels, according 
[Page 19] to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John; the Acts of the Apostles written by Luke 
the Evangelist; fourteen epistles of Paul the apostle, (one) to the Romans, two to the 
Corinthians, (one) to the Galatians, to the Ephesians, to the Philippians, to the Colossians, 
two to the Thessalonians, two to Timothy, (one) to Titus, to Philemon, to the Hebrews; 
two of Peter the apostle, three of John the apostle, one of the apostle James, one of Jude 
the apostle, and the Apocalypse of John the apostle. But if any one receive not, as sacred 
and canonical, the said books entire with all their parts, as they have been used to be read 
in the Catholic Church, and as they are contained in the old Latin vulgate edition; and 
knowingly and deliberately contemn the traditions aforesaid; let him be anathema. Let all, 
therefore, understand, in what order, and in what manner, the said Synod, after having 
laid the foundation of the Confession of faith, will proceed, and what testimonies and 
authorities it will mainly use in confirming dogmas, and in restoring morals in the Church.
 DECREE CONCERNING THE EDITION, AND THE USE, OF THE SACRED BOOKS 
Moreover, the same sacred and holy Synod,--considering that no small utility may accrue 
to the Church of God, if it be made known which out of all the Latin editions, now in 
circulation, of the sacred books, is to be held as authentic,--ordains and declares, that the 
said old and vulgate edition, which, by the lengthened usage of so many years, has been 
approved of in the Church, be, in public lectures, disputations, sermons and expositions, 
held as authentic; and that no one is to dare, or presume to reject it under any pretext 
whatever. 
Furthermore, in order to restrain petulant spirits, It decrees, that no one, relying on his 
own skill, shall,--in matters of faith, and of morals pertaining to the edification of 
Christian doctrine, --wresting the sacred Scripture to his own senses, presume to interpret 
the said sacred Scripture contrary to that sense which holy mother Church,--whose it is to 
judge of the true sense and interpretation of the holy Scriptures,--hath held and doth hold; 
[Page 20] or even contrary to the unanimous consent of the Fathers; even though such 
interpretations were never (intended) to be at any time published. Contraveners shall be 
made known by their Ordinaries, and be punished with the penalties by law established. 
And wishing, as is just, to impose a restraint, in this matter, also on printers, who now 
without restraint,--thinking, that is, that whatsoever they please is allowed them,--print, 
without the license of ecclesiastical superiors, the said books of sacred Scripture, and the 
notes and comments upon them of all persons indifferently, with the press ofttimes 
unnamed, often even fictitious, and what is more grievous still, without the author's name; 
and also keep for indiscriminate sale books of this kind printed elsewhere; (this Synod) 
ordains and decrees, that, henceforth, the sacred Scripture, and especially the said old and 
vulgate edition, be printed in the most correct manner possible; and that it shall not be 
lawful for any one to print, or cause to be printed, any books whatever, on sacred matters, 
without the name of the author; nor to sell them in future, or even to keep them, unless 
they shall have been first examined, and approved of, by the Ordinary; under pain of the 
anathema and fine imposed in a canon of the last Council of Lateran: and, if they be 
Regulars, besides this examination and approval, they shall be bound to obtain a license 
also from their own superiors, who shall have examined the books according to the form 
of their own statutes. As to those who lend, or circulate them in manuscript, without their 
having been first examined, and approved of, they shall be subjected to the same penalties 
as printers: and they who shall have them in their possession or shall read them, shall, 
unless they discover the authors, be themselves regarded as the authors. And the said 
approbation of books of this kind shall be given in writing; and for this end it shall appear 
authentically at the beginning of the book, whether the book be written, or printed; and all 
this, that is, both the approbation and the examination, shall be done gratis, that so what 
ought to be approved, may be approved, and what ought to be condemned, may be 
condemned. 
Besides the above, wishing to repress that temerity, by which the words and sentences of 
sacred Scripture are turned and [Page 21] twisted to all sorts of profane uses, to wit, to 
things scurrilous, fabulous, vain, to flatteries, detractions, superstitions, impious and 
diabolical incantations, sorceries, and defamatory libels; (the Synod) commands and 
enjoins, for the doing away with this kind of irreverence and contempt, and that no one 
may hence forth dare in any way to apply the words of sacred Scripture to these and such 
like purposes; that all men of this description, profaners and violators of the word of God, 
be by the bishops restrained by the penalties of law, and others of their own appointment. 
INDICTION OF THE NEXT SESSION 
Likewise, this sacred and holy Synod resolves and decrees, that the next ensuing Session 
be held and celebrated on the Thursday after the next most sacred festival of Pentecost.

 DECREE CONCERNING ORIGINAL SIN 
That our Catholic faith, without which it is impossible to please God, may, errors being 
purged away, continue in its own perfect and spotless integrity, and that the Christian 
people may not be carried about with every wind of doctrine; whereas that old serpent, the 
perpetual enemy of mankind, amongst the very many evils with which the Church of God 
is in these our times troubled, has also stirred up not only new, but even old, dissensions 
touching original sin, and the remedy thereof; the sacred and holy, ecumenical and 
general Synod of Trent,--lawfully assembled in the Holy Ghost, the three same legates of 
the Apostolic See presiding therein,--wishing now to come to the reclaiming of the erring, 
and the confirming of the wavering,--following the testimonies of the sacred [Page 22] 
Scriptures, of the holy Fathers, of the most approved councils, and the judgment and 
consent of the Church itself, ordains, confesses, and declares these things touching the 
said original sin: 
1. If any one does not confess that the first man, Adam, when he had transgressed the 
commandment of God in Paradise, immediately lost the holiness and justice wherein he 
had been constituted; and that he incurred, through the offence of that prevarication, the 
wrath and indignation of God, and consequently death, with which God had previously 
threatened him, and, together with death, captivity under his power who thenceforth had 
the empire of death, that is to say, the devil, and that the entire Adam, through that 
offence of prevarication, was changed, in body and soul, for the worse; let him be 
anathema. 
2. If any one asserts, that the prevarication of Adam injured himself alone, and not his 
posterity; and that the holiness and justice, received of God, which he lost, he lost for 
himself alone, and not for us also; or that he, being defiled by the sin of disobedience, has 
only transfused death, and pains of the body, into the whole human race, but not sin also, 
which is the death of the soul; let him be anathema:--whereas he contradicts the apostle 
who says; By one man sin entered into the world, and by sin death, and so death passed 
upon all men, in whom all have sinned. 
3. If any one asserts, that this sin of Adam,--which in its origin is one, and being 
transfused into all by propogation, not by imitation, is in each one as his own, --is taken 
away either by the powers of human nature, or by any other remedy than the merit of the 
one mediator, our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath reconciled us to God in his own blood, 
made unto us justice, santification, and redemption; or if he denies that the said merit of 
Jesus Christ is applied, both to adults and to infants, by the sacrament of baptism rightly 
administered in the form of the church; let him be anathema: For there is no other name 
under heaven given to men, whereby we must be [Page 23] saved. Whence that voice; 
Behold the lamb of God behold him who taketh away the sins of the world; and that 
other; As many as have been baptized, have put on Christ. 
4. If any one denies, that infants, newly born from their mothers' wombs, even though 
they be sprung from baptized parents, are to be baptized; or says that they are baptized 
indeed for the remission of sins, but that they derive nothing of original sin from Adam, 
which has need of being expiated by the laver of regeneration for the obtaining life 
everlasting,--whence it follows as a consequence, that in them the form of baptism, for the 
remission of sins, is understood to be not true, but false, --let him be anathema. For that 
which the apostle has said, By one man sin entered into the world, and by sin death, and 
so death passed upon all men in whom all have sinned, is not to be understood otherwise 
than as the Catholic Church spread everywhere hath always understood it. For, by reason 
of this rule of faith, from a tradition of the apostles, even infants, who could not as yet 
commit any sin of themselves, are for this cause truly baptized for the remission of sins, 
that in them that may be cleansed away by regeneration, which they have contracted by 
generation. For, unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter 
into the kingdom of God. 
5. If any one denies, that, by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is conferred in 
baptism, the guilt of original sin is remitted; or even asserts that the whole of that which 
has the true and proper nature of sin is not taken away; but says that it is only rased, or not 
imputed; let him be anathema. For, in those who are born again, there is nothing that God 
hates; because, There is no condemnation to those who are truly buried together with 
Christ by baptism into death; who walk not according to the flesh, but, putting off the old 
man, and putting on the new who is created according to God, are made inno-[Page 24]
 cent, immaculate, pure, harmless, and beloved of God, heirs indeed of God, but joint heirs 
with Christ; so that there is nothing whatever to retard their entrance into heaven. But this 
holy synod confesses and is sensible, that in the baptized there remains concupiscence, or 
an incentive (to sin); which, whereas it is left for our exercise, cannot injure those who 
consent not, but resist manfully by the grace of Jesus Christ; yea, he who shall have 
striven lawfully shall be crowned. This concupiscence, which the apostle sometimes calls 
sin, the holy Synod declares that the Catholic Church has never understood it to be called 
sin, as being truly and properly sin in those born again, but because it is of sin, and 
inclines to sin. 
This same holy Synod doth nevertheless declare, that it is not its intention to include in 
this decree, where original sin is treated of, the blessed and immaculate Virgin Mary, the 
mother of God; but that the constitutions of Pope Sixtus IV., of happy memory, are to be 
observed, under the pains contained in the said constitutions, which it renews. 
DECREE ON REFORMATION 
CHAPTER I.  
On the Institution of a Lectureship of Sacred Scripture, and of the liberal arts. 
The same sacred and holy Synod, adhering to the pious constitutions of the Sovereign 
Pontiffs, and of approved councils, and embracing and adding to them; that the heavenly 
treasure of the sacred books, which the Holy Ghost has with the greatest liberality 
delivered unto men, may not lie neglected, hath or-[Page 25]dained and decreed, that,--in 
those churches where there is found to be a prebend, prestimony, or other stipend under 
whatsoever name, destined for lecturers in sacred theology,--the bishops, archbishops, 
primates, and other Ordinaries of those places shall force and compel, even by the 
substraction of the fruits, those who hold such prebend, prestimony, or stipend, to 
expound and interpret the said sacred Scripture, either personally, if they be competent, or 
otherwise by a competent substitute, to be chosen by the said bishops, archbishops, 
primates, and other Ordinaries of those places. But, for the future, let not such prebend, 
prestimony, or stipend be bestowed save on competent persons, and those who can 
themselves discharge that office; and otherwise let the provision made be null and void. 
But in metropolitan, or cathedral churches, if the city be distinguished and populous,--and 
also in collegiate churches which are in any large town, even though they may not belong 
to any diocese, provided the clergy be numerous there,--wherein there is no such prebend, 
prestimony, or stipend set aside for this purpose, let the first prebend that shall become 
vacant in any way soever, except by resignation, and to which some other incompatible 
duty is not attached, be understood to be ipso facto set apart and devoted to that purpose 
for ever. And in case that in the said churches there should not be any, or not any 
sufficient, prebend, let the metropolitan, or the bishop himself, by assigning thereunto the 
fruits of some simple benefice,--the obligations thereto belonging being nevertheless 
discharged,--or by the contributions of the beneficiaries of his city and diocese, or 
otherwise, as may be most convenient, provide in such wise, with the advice of his 
chapter, as that the said lecture of sacred Scripture be had; yet so that whatsoever other 
lectures there may be, whether established by custom, or in any other way, be not by any 
means therefore omitted. 
As to churches, whose annual revenues are slight, and where the number of the clergy and 
laity is so small, that a lectureship of Theology cannot be conveniently had therein, let 
them at least have a master--to be chosen by the bishop, with the advice of the chapter--to 
teach grammar gratuitously to clerics, and other poor scholars, that so they may 
afterwards, with God's blessing, [Page 26] pass on to the said study of sacred Scripture. 
And for this end, either let the fruits of some simple benefice be assigned to that master of 
grammar,--which fruits he shall receive so long as he continues teaching, provided 
however, that the said benefice be not deprived of the duty due to it,--or let some suitable 
remuneration be paid him out of the episcopal or capitular revenue; or in fine let the 
bishop himself devise some other method suited to his church and diocese; that so this 
pious, useful, and profitable provision may not be, under any colourable pretext whatever, 
neglected. 
In the monasteries also of monks, let there be in like manner a lecture on sacred Scripture, 
where this can be conveniently done: wherein of the abbots be negligent, let the bishops 
of the places, as the delegates herein of the Apostolic See, compel them thereto by 
suitable remedies. And in the convents of other Regulars, in which studies can 
conveniently flourish, let there be in like manner a lectureship of sacred Scripture; which 
lectureship shall be assigned, by the general or provincial chapters, to the more able 
masters. 
In the public colleges also, wherein a lectureship so honourable, and the most necessary 
of all, has not hitherto been instituted, let it be established by the piety and charity of the 
most religious princes and governments, for the defence and increase of the Catholic 
faith, and the preservation and propagation of sound doctrine; and where such lectureship, 
after being once instituted, has been neglected, let it be restored. And that impiety may 
not be disseminated under the semblance of piety, the same holy Synod ordains, that no 
one be admitted to this office of lecturing, whether in public or in private, without having 
been previously examined and approved of by the bishop of the place, as to his life, 
conversation, and knowledge: which however is not to be understood of lecturers in 
convents of monks. Furthermore, those who are teaching the said sacred Scripture, as long 
as they teach publicly in the schools, as also the scholars who are studying in those 
schools, shall fully enjoy [Page 27] and possess, though absent, all the privileges 
accorded by common law, as regards the reception of the fruits of their prebends and 
benefices. 
CHAPTER II.  
On Preachers of the word of God, and on Questors of alms. 
But seeing that the preaching of the Gospel is no less necessary to the Christian 
commonwealth than the reading thereof; and whereas this is the principal duty of bishops; 
the same holy Synod hath resolved and decreed, that all bishops, archbishops, primates, 
and all other prelates of the churches be bound personally--if they be not lawfully 
hindered--to preach the holy Gospel of Jesus Christ. But if it should happen that bishops, 
and the others aforesaid, be hindered by any lawful impediment, they shall be bound, in 
accordance with the form prescribed by the general Council (of Lateran), to appoint fit 
persons to discharge wholesomely this office of preaching. But if any one through 
contempt do not execute this, let him be subjected to rigorous punishment. 
Archpriests, curates, and all those who in any manner soever hold any parochial, or other, 
churches, which have the cure of souls, shall, at least on the Lord's days, and solemn 
feasts, either personally, or if they be lawfully hindered, by others who are competent, 
feed the people committed to them, with wholesome words, according to their own 
capacity, and that of their people; by teaching them the things which it is necessary for all 
to knew unto salvation, and by announcing to them with briefness and plainness of 
discourse, the vices which they must avoid, and the virtues which they must follow after, 
that they may escape everlasting punishment, and obtain the glory of heaven. And if any 
one of the above neglect to discharge this duty,--even though he may plead, on 
whatsoever ground, that he [Page 28] is exempt from the jurisdiction of the bishop, and 
even though the churches may be, in whatsoever way, said to be exempted, or haply 
annexed or united to a monastery that is even out of the diocese,--let not the watchful 
pastoral solicitude of the bishops be wanting, provided those churches be really within 
their diocese; lest that word be fulfilled; The little ones have asked for bread, and there 
was none to break it unto them. Wherefore, if, after having been admonished by the 
bishop, they shall neglect this their duty for the space of three months, let them be 
compelled by ecclesiastical censures, or otherwise, at the discretion of the said bishop; in 
such wise that even-if this seem to him expedient-a fair remuneration be paid, out of the 
fruits of the benefices, to some other person to discharge that office, until the principal 
himself repenting shall fulfil his own duty. 
But should there be found to be any parochial churches, subject to monasteries which are 
not in any diocese, if the abbots and Regular prelates be negligent in the matters 
aforesaid, let them be compelled thereto by the metropolitans, in whose provinces the said 
dioceses are situated, as the delegate for that end of the Apostolic See; nor let custom, or 
exemption, or appeal, or reclamation, or action of recovery be of effect to impede the 
execution of this decree; until by a competent judge,--who shall proceed summarily, and 
examine only into the truth of the (matter of) fact,--the case shall have been taken 
cognizance of, and decided. 
Regulars, of whatsoever order they may be, may not preach even in the churches of their 
own orders, unless they have been examined and approved of as regards their life, 
manners, and knowledge, by their own superiors, and with his license; with which license 
they shall be bound to present themselves personally before the bishops, and beg a 
blessing from them, before they begin to preach. But, (to preach) in churches which are 
not those of their own orders, besides the license of their own superiors they shall be 
obliged to have also the license of the bishop, without which they may not on any account 
preach in the said churches which belong not to their own orders: but bishops shall grant 
[Page 29] the said license gratuitously. 
But if, which God forbid, a preacher should spread errors, or scandals, amongst the 
people, let the bishop interdict his preaching, even though he preach in a monastery of his 
own, or of another, order: whereas, if he preach heresies, let him proceed against him 
according to the appointment of the law, or the custom of the place, even though the said 
preacher should plead that he is exempted by a general, or special, privilege: in which 
case the bishop shall proceed by apostolic authority, and as the delegate of the Apostolic 
See. But let bishops be careful, that a preacher be not annoyed, either by false 
accusations, or in any other way calumniously; or have any just cause of complaint 
against them. 
Furthermore, let bishops be on their guard not to permit any one,--whether of those, who, 
being Regulars in name, live nevertheless out of their monasteries, and the obedience of 
their religious institute, or secular priests, unless they be known to them, and are of 
approved morals and doctrine,--to preach in their own city, and diocese, even under the 
pretext of any privilege whatsoever; until the holy Apostolic See has been consulted by 
the said bishops thereon; from which See it is not likely that unworthy persons can extort 
any such privileges, except by suppressing the truth, or by uttering what is false. 
Those who quest for alms--who are also commonly called Questors-of whatsoever 
condition they may be, shall not in any way presume, either personally, or by another, to 
preach; and Contraveners shall, any privileges notwithstanding, be wholly restrained by 
suitable remedies, by the bishop and Ordinaries of the places.

DECREE ON JUSTIFICATION 
Proem. 
Whereas there is, at this time, not without the shipwreck of many souls, and grievous 
detriment to the unity of the Church, a certain erroneous doctrine disseminated touching 
Justification; the sacred and holy, oecumenical and general Synod of Trent, lawfully 
assembled in the Holy Ghost,--the most reverend lords, Giammaria del Monte, bishop of 
Palaestrina, and Marcellus of the title of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, priest, cardinals of 
the holy Roman Church, and legates apostolic a latere, presiding therein, in the name of 
our most holy father and lord in Christ, Paul III., by the providence of God, Pope,
purposes, unto the praise and glory of Almighty God, the tranquillising of the Church, and 
the salvation of souls, to expound to all the faithful of Christ the true and sound doctrine 
touching the said Justification; which (doctrine) the sun of justice, Christ Jesus, the author 
and finisher of our faith, taught, which the apostles transmitted, and which the Catholic 
Church, the Holy Ghost reminding her thereof, has always retained; most strictly 
forbidding that any henceforth presume to believe, preach, or teach, otherwise than as by 
this present decree is defined and declared. 
CHAPTER I.  
On the Inability of Nature and of the Law to justify man. 
The holy Synod declares first, that, for the correct and sound understanding of the 
doctrine of Justification, it is necessary [Page 31] that each one recognise and confess, 
that, whereas all men had lost their innocence in the prevarication of Adam-having 
become unclean, and, as the apostle says, by nature children of wrath, as (this Synod) has 
set forth in the decree on original sin,-they were so far the servants of sin, and under the 
power of the devil and of death, that not the Gentiles only by the force of nature, but not 
even the Jews by the very letter itself of the law of Moses, were able to be liberated, or to 
arise, therefrom; although free will, attenuated as it was in its powers, and bent down, was 
by no means extinguished in them. 
CHAPTER II.  
On the dispensation and mystery of Christ's advent. 
Whence it came to pass, that the heavenly Father, the father of mercies and the God of all 
comfort, when that blessed fulness of the time was come, sent unto men, Jesus Christ, His 
own Son-who had been, both before the Law, and during the time of the Law, to many of 
the holy fathers announced and promised-that He might both redeem the Jews who were 
under the Law, and that the Gentiles, who followed not after justice, might attain to 
justice, and that all men might receive the adoption of sons. Him God hath proposed as a 
propitiator, through faith in his blood, for our sins, and not for our sins only, but also for 
those of the whole world. 
CHAPTER III.  
Who are justified through Christ. 
But, though He died for all, yet do not all receive the benefit of His [Page 32] death, but 
those only unto whom the merit of His passion is communicated. For as in truth men, if 
they were not born propagated of the seed of Adam, would not be born unjust,-seeing 
that, by that propagation, they contract through him, when they are conceived, injustice as 
their own,-so, if they were not born again in Christ, they never would be justified; seeing 
that, in that new birth, there is bestowed upon them, through the merit of His passion, the 
grace whereby they are made just. For this benefit the apostle exhorts us, evermore to 
give thanks to the Father, who hath made us worthy to be partakers of the lot of the saints 
in light, and hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the 
Kingdom of the Son of his love, in whom we have redemption, and remission of sins. 
CHAPTER IV.  
A description is introduced of the Justification of the impious, and of the Manner thereof 
under the law of grace. 
By which words, a description of the Justification of the impious is indicated,-as being a 
translation, from that state wherein man is born a child of the first Adam, to the state of 
grace, and of the adoption of the sons of God, through the second Adam, Jesus Christ, our 
Saviour. And this translation, since the promulgation of the Gospel, cannot be effected, 
without the laver of regeneration, or the desire thereof, as it is written; unless a man be 
born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. 
CHAPTER V.  
On the necessity, in adults, of preparation for Justification, and whence it proceeds. 
The Synod furthermore declares, that in adults, the beginning of the said Justification is to 
be derived from the prevenient [Page 33] grace of God, through Jesus Christ, that is to 
say, from His vocation, whereby, without any merits existing on their parts, they are 
called; that so they, who by sins were alienated from God, may be disposed through His 
quickening and assisting grace, to convert themselves to their own justification, by freely 
assenting to and co-operating with that said grace: in such sort that, while God touches the 
heart of man by the illumination of the Holy Ghost, neither is man himself utterly without 
doing anything while he receives that inspiration, forasmuch as he is also able to reject it; 
yet is he not able, by his own free will, without the grace of God, to move himself unto 
justice in His sight. Whence, when it is said in the sacred writings: Turn ye to me, and I 
will turn to you, we are admonished of our liberty; and when we answer; Convert us, O 
Lord, to thee, and we shall be converted, we confess that we are prevented by the grace of 
God. 
CHAPTER VI.  
The manner of Preparation.
 Now they (adults) are disposed unto the said justice, when, excited and assisted by divine 
grace, conceiving faith by hearing, they are freely moved towards God, believing those 
things to be true which God has revealed and promised,-and this especially, that God 
justifies the impious by His grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus; and 
when, understanding themselves to be sinners, they, by turning themselves, from the fear 
of divine justice whereby they are profitably agitated, to consider the mercy of God, are 
raised unto hope, confiding that God will be propitious to them for Christ's sake; and they 
begin to love Him as the fountain of all justice; and are therefore moved against sins by a 
certain hatred and detestation, to wit, by that penitence which must be performed before 
baptism: lastly, when they purpose to receive baptism, [Page 34] to begin a new life, and 
to keep the commandments of God. Concerning this disposition it is written; He that 
cometh to God, must believe that he is, and is a rewarder to them that seek him; and, Be 
of good faith, son, thy sins are forgiven thee; and, The fear of the Lord driveth out sin; 
and, Do penance, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the 
remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost; and, Going, 
therefore, teach ye all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, 
and of the Holy Ghost; finally, Prepare your hearts unto the Lord. 
CHAPTER VII.  
What the justification of the impious is, and what are the causes thereof. 
This disposition, or preparation, is followed by Justification itself, which is not remission 
of sins merely, but also the sanctification and renewal of the inward man, through the 
voluntary reception of the grace, and of the gifts, whereby man of unjust becomes just, 
and of an enemy a friend, that so he may be an heir according to hope of life everlasting. 
Of this Justification the causes are these: the final cause indeed is the glory of God and of 
Jesus Christ, and life everlasting; while the efficient cause is a merciful God who washes 
and sanctifies gratuitously, signing, and anointing with the holy Spirit of promise, who is 
the pledge of our inheritance; but the meritorious cause is His most beloved only
begotten, our Lord Jesus Christ, who, when we were enemies, for the exceeding charity 
wherewith he loved us, merited Justification for us by His most holy Passion on the wood 
of the cross, and made satisfaction for us unto God the Father; the instru-[Page 35]mental 
cause is the sacrament of baptism, which is the sacrament of faith, without which (faith) 
no man was ever justified; lastly, the alone formal cause is the justice of God, not that 
whereby He Himself is just, but that whereby He maketh us just, that, to wit, with which 
we being endowed by Him, are renewed in the spirit of our mind, and we are not only 
reputed, but are truly called, and are, just, receiving justice within us, each one according 
to his own measure, which the Holy Ghost distributes to every one as He wills, and 
according to each one's proper disposition and co-operation. For, although no one can be 
just, but he to whom the merits of the Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ are communicated, 
yet is this done in the said justification of the impious, when by the merit of that same 
most holy Passion, the charity of God is poured forth, by the Holy Spirit, in the hearts of 
those that are justified, and is inherent therein: whence, man, through Jesus Christ, in 
whom he is ingrafted, receives, in the said justification, together with the remission of 
sins, all these (gifts) infused at once, faith, hope, and charity. For faith, unless hope and 
charity be added thereto, neither unites man perfectly with Christ, nor makes him a living 
member of His body. For which reason it is most truly said, that Faith without works is 
dead and profitless; and, In Christ Jesus neither circumcision, availeth anything, nor 
uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by charity. This faith, Catechumen's beg of the 
Church-agreeably to a tradition of the apostles-previously to the sacrament of Baptism; 
when they beg for the faith which bestows life everlasting, which, without hope and 
charity, faith cannot bestow: whence also do they immediately hear that word of Christ; If 
thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. Wherefore, when receiving true and 
Christian justice, they are bidden, immediately on being born again, to preserve it pure 
and spotless, as the first robe given them through Jesus Christ in lieu of that which [Page 
36] Adam, by his disobedience, lost for himself and for us, that so they may bear it before 
the judgment-seat of our Lord Jesus Christ, and may have life everlasting. 
CHAPTER VIII.  
In what manner it is to be understood, that the impious is justified by faith, and 
gratuitously. 
And whereas the Apostle saith, that man is justified by faith and freely, those words are to 
be understood in that sense which the perpetual consent of the Catholic Church hath held 
and expressed; to wit, that we are therefore said to be justified by faith, because faith is 
the beginning of human salvation, the foundation, and the root of all Justification; without 
which it is impossible to please God, and to come unto the fellowship of His sons: but we 
are therefore said to be justified freely, because that none of those things which precede 
justification-whether faith or works-merit the grace itself of justification. For, if it be a 
grace, it is not now by works, otherwise, as the same Apostle says, grace is no more 
grace. 
CHAPTER IX.  
Against the vain confidence of Heretics. 
But, although it is necessary to believe that sins neither are remitted, nor ever were 
remitted save gratuitously by the mercy of God for Christ's sake; yet is it not to be said, 
that sins are forgiven, or have been forgiven, to any one who boasts of his confidence and 
certainty of the remission of his sins, and rests on that alone; seeing that it may exist, yea 
does in our day exist, amongst heretics and schismatics; and with great vehemence is this 
vain confidence, and one alien from all godliness, preached up in opposition to the 
Catholic Church. But neither [Page 37] is this to be asserted,-that they who are truly 
justified must needs, without any doubting whatever, settle within themselves that they 
are justified, and that no one is absolved from sins and justified, but he that believes for 
certain that he is absolved and justified; and that absolution and justification are effected 
by this faith alone: as though whoso has not this belief, doubts of the promises of God, 
and of the efficacy of the death and resurrection of Christ. For even as no pious person 
ought to doubt of the mercy of God, of the merit of Christ, and of the virtue and efficacy 
of the sacraments, even so each one, when he regards himself, and his own weakness and 
indisposition, may have fear and apprehension touching his own grace; seeing that no one 
can know with a certainty of faith, which cannot be subject to error, that he has obtained 
the grace of God. 
CHAPTER X.  
On the increase of Justification received. 
Having, therefore, been thus justified, and made the friends and domestics of God, 
advancing from virtue to virtue, they are renewed, as the Apostle says, day by day; that is, 
by mortifying the members of their own flesh, and by presenting them as instruments of 
justice unto sanctification, they, through the observance of the commandments of God 
and of the Church, faith co-operating with good works, increase in that justice which they 
have received through the grace of Christ, and are still further justified, as it is written; He 
that is just, let him be justified still; and again, Be not afraid to be justified even to death; 
and also, Do you see that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only. And this 
increase of justification holy Church begs, when she prays, "Give unto us, O Lord, 
increase of faith, hope, and charity." 
[Page 38] 
CHAPTER XI.  
On keeping the Commandments, and on the necessity and possibility thereof. 
But no one, how much soever justified, ought to think himself exempt from the 
observance of the commandments; no one ought to make use of that rash saying, one 
prohibited by the Fathers under an anathema,-that the observance of the commandments 
of God is impossible for one that is justified. For God commands not impossibilities, but, 
by commanding, both admonishes thee to do what thou are able, and to pray for what thou 
art not able (to do), and aids thee that thou mayest be able; whose commandments are not 
heavy; whose yoke is sweet and whose burthen light. For, whoso are the sons of God, 
love Christ; but they who love him, keep his commandments, as Himself testifies; which, 
assuredly, with the divine help, they can do. For, although, during this mortal life, men, 
how holy and just soever, at times fall into at least light and daily sins, which are also 
called venial, not therefore do they cease to be just. For that cry of the just, Forgive us our 
trespasses, is both humble and true. And for this cause, the just themselves ought to feel 
themselves the more obligated to walk in the way of justice, in that, being already freed 
from sins, but made servants of God, they are able, living soberly, justly, and godly, to 
proceed onwards through Jesus Christ, by whom they have had access unto this grace. For 
God forsakes not those who have been once justified by His grace, unless he be first 
forsaken by them. Wherefore, no one ought to flatter himself up with faith alone, fancying 
that by faith alone he is made an heir, and will obtain the inheritance, even though he 
suffer not with Christ, that so he may be also glori-[Page 39]fied with him. For even 
Christ Himself, as the Apostle saith, Whereas he was the son of God, learned obedience 
by the things which he suffered, and being consummated, he became, to all who obey 
him, the cause of eternal salvation. For which cause the same Apostle admonishes the 
justified, saying; Know you not that they that run in the race, all run indeed, but one 
receiveth the prize? So run that you may obtain. I therefore so run, not as at an 
uncertainty: I so fight, not as one beating the air, but I chastise my body, and bring it into 
subjection; lest perhaps, when I have preached to others, I myself should become a cast
away. So also the prince of the apostles, Peter; Labour the more that by good works you 
may make sure your calling and election. For doing those things, you shall not sin at any 
time. From which it is plain, that those are opposed to the orthodox doctrine of religion, 
who assert that the just man sins, venially at least, in every good work; or, which is yet 
more insupportable, that he merits eternal punishments; as also those who state, that the 
just sin in all their works, if, in those works, they, together with this aim principally that 
God may be gloried, have in view also the eternal reward, in order to excite their sloth, 
and to encourage themselves to run in the course: whereas it is written, I have inclined my 
heart to do all thy justifications for the reward: and, concerning Moses, the Apostle saith, 
that he looked unto the reward. 
CHAPTER XII.  
That a rash presumptuousness in the matter of Predestination is to be avoided. 
No one, moreover, so long as he is in this mortal life, ought so far to presume as regards 
the secret mystery of divine predestination, as to determine for certain that he is assuredly 
in [Page 40] the number of the predestinate; as if it were true, that he that is justified, 
either cannot sin any more, or, if he do sin, that he ought to promise himself an assured 
repentance; for except by special revelation, it cannot be known whom God hath chosen 
unto Himself. 
CHAPTER XIII.  
On the gift of Perseverance. 
So also as regards the gift of perseverance, of which it is written, He that shall persevere 
to the end, he shall be saved:-which gift cannot be derived from any other but Him, who 
is able to establish him who standeth that he stand perseveringly, and to restore him who 
falleth:-let no one herein promise himself any thing as certain with an absolute certainty; 
though all ought to place and repose a most firm hope in God's help. For God, unless men 
be themselves wanting to His grace, as he has begun the good work, so will he perfect it, 
working (in them) to will and to accomplish. Nevertheless, let those who think themselves 
to stand, take heed lest they fall, and, with fear and trembling work out their salvation, in 
labours, in watchings, in almsdeeds, in prayers and oblations, in fastings and chastity: for, 
knowing that they are born again unto a hope of glory, but not as yet unto glory, they 
ought to fear for the combat which yet remains with the flesh, with the world, with the 
devil, wherein they cannot be victorious, unless they be with God's grace, obedient to the 
Apostle, who says; We are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh; for if 
you live according to the flesh, you shall die; but if by the spirit you mortify the deeds of 
the flesh, you shall live. 
[Page 41] 
CHAPTER XIV.  
On the fallen, and their restoration. 
As regards those who, by sin, have fallen from the received grace of Justification, they 
may be again justified, when, God exciting them, through the sacrament of Penance they 
shall have attained to the recovery, by the merit of Christ, of the grace lost: for this 
manner of Justification is of the fallen the reparation: which the holy Fathers have aptly 
called a second plank after the shipwreck of grace lost. For, on behalf of those who fall 
into sins after baptism, Christ Jesus instituted the sacrament of Penance, when He said, 
Receive ye the Holy Ghost, whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them, and 
whose sins you shall retain, they are retained. Whence it is to be taught, that the penitence 
of a Christian, after his fall, is very different from that at (his) baptism; and that therein 
are included not only a cessation from sins, and a detestation thereof, or, a contrite and 
humble heart, but also the sacramental confession of the said sins,-at least in desire, and to 
be made in its season,-and sacerdotal absolution; and likewise satisfaction by fasts, alms, 
prayers, and the other pious exercises of a spiritual life; not indeed for the eternal 
punishment,-which is, together with the guilt, remitted, either by the sacrament, or by the 
desire of the sacrament,-but for the temporal punishment, which, as the sacred writings 
teach, is not always wholly remitted, as is done in baptism, to those who, ungrateful to the 
grace of God which they have received, have grieved the Holy Spirit, and have not feared 
to violate the temple of God. Concerning which penitence it is written; Be mindful 
whence thou art fallen; do penance, and do the first works. And again; The sorrow that is 
according to [Page 42] God worketh penance steadfast unto salvation. And again; Do 
penance, and bring forth fruits worthy of penance. 
CHAPTER XV.  
That, by every mortal sin, grace is lost, but not faith. 
In opposition also to the subtle wits of certain men, who, by pleasing speeches and good 
words, seduce the hearts of the innocent, it is to be maintained, that the received grace of 
Justification is lost, not only by infidelity whereby even faith itself is lost, but also by any 
other mortal sin whatever, though faith be not lost; thus defending the doctrine of the 
divine law, which excludes from the kingdom of God not only the unbelieving, but the 
faithful also (who are) fornicators, adulterers, effeminate, liers with mankind, thieves, 
covetous, drunkards, railers, extortioners, and all others who commit deadly sins; from 
which, with the help of divine grace, they can refrain, and on account of which they are 
separated from the grace of Christ. 
CHAPTER XVI.  
On the fruit of Justification, that is, on the merit of good works, and on the nature of that 
merit. 
Before men, therefore, who have been justified in this manner,-whether they have 
preserved uninterruptedly the grace received, or whether they have recovered it when 
lost,-are to be set the words of the Apostle: Abound in every good work, knowing that 
your labour is not in vain in the Lord; for God is not unjust, that he should forget your 
work, and the love which you have shown in his name; and, do not lose your confidence, 
which hath a great reward. And, for this cause, life eternal is to be proposed to those 
working well unto [Page 43] the end, and hoping in God, both as a grace mercifully 
promised to the sons of God through Jesus Christ, and as a reward which is according to 
the promise of God Himself, to be faithfully rendered to their good works and merits. For 
this is that crown of justice which the Apostle declared was, after his fight and course, 
laid up for him, to be rendered to him by the just judge, and not only to him, but also to all 
that love his coming. For, whereas Jesus Christ Himself continually infuses his virtue into 
the said justified,-as the head into the members, and the vine into the branches,-and this 
virtue always precedes and accompanies and follows their good works, which without it 
could not in any wise be pleasing and meritorious before God,-we must believe that 
nothing further is wanting to the justified, to prevent their being accounted to have, by 
those very works which have been done in God, fully satisfied the divine law according to 
the state of this life, and to have truly merited eternal life, to be obtained also in its (due) 
time, if so be, however, that they depart in grace: seeing that Christ, our Saviour, saith: If 
any one shall drink of the water that I will give him, he shall not thirst for ever; but it shall 
become in him a fountain of water springing up unto life everlasting. Thus, neither is our 
own justice established as our own as from ourselves; nor is the justice of God ignored or 
repudiated: for that justice which is called ours, because that we are justified from its 
being inherent in us, that same is (the justice) of God, because that it is infused into us of 
God, through the merit of Christ. Neither is this to be omitted,-that although, in the sacred 
writings, so much is attributed to good works, that Christ promises, that even he that shall 
give a drink of cold water to one of his least ones, shall not lose his reward; and the 
Apostle testifies that, That which is at present momentary and light of our tribulation, 
worketh for us above measure exceedingly an eternal weight of glory; nevertheless God 
forbid that a Christian should either trust or glory in himself, and not in the Lord, whose 
bounty towards all [Page 44] men is so great, that He will have the things which are His 
own gifts be their merits. And forasmuch as in many things we all offend, each one ought 
to have before his eyes, as well the severity and judgment, as the mercy and goodness (of 
God); neither ought any one to judge himself, even though he be not conscious to himself 
of anything; because the whole life of man is to be examined and judged, not by the 
judgment of man, but of God, who will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and 
will make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then shall every man have praise from 
God, who, as it is written, will render to every man according to his works. After this 
Catholic doctrine on Justification, which whoso receiveth not faithfully and firmly cannot 
be justified, it hath seemed good to the holy Synod to subjoin these canons, that all may 
know not only what they ought to hold and follow, but also what to avoid and shun. 
ON JUSTIFICATION 
CANON I.-If any one saith, that man may be justified before God by his own works, 
whether done through the teaching of human nature, or that of the law, without the grace 
of God through Jesus Christ; let him be anathema. 
CANON II.-If any one saith, that the grace of God, through Jesus Christ, is given only for 
this, that man may be able more easily to live justly, and to merit eternal life, as if, by free 
will without grace, he were able to do both, though hardly indeed and with difficulty; let 
him be anathema. 
CANON III.-If any one saith, that without the prevenient inspiration of the Holy Ghost, 
and without his help, man can believe, hope, love, or be penitent as he ought, so as that 
the grace of Justification may be bestowed upon him; let him be anathema. 
[Page 45] CANON IV.-If any one saith, that man's free will moved and excited by God, 
by assenting to God exciting and calling, nowise co-operates towards disposing and 
preparing itself for obtaining the grace of Justification; that it cannot refuse its consent, if 
it would, but that, as something inanimate, it does nothing whatever and is merely 
passive; let him be anathema. 
CANON V.-If any one saith, that, since Adam's sin, the free will of man is lost and 
extinguished; or, that it is a thing with only a name, yea a name without a reality, a 
figment, in fine, introduced into the Church by Satan; let him be anathema. 
CANON VI.-If any one saith, that it is not in man's power to make his ways evil, but that 
the works that are evil God worketh as well as those that are good, not permissively only, 
but properly, and of Himself, in such wise that the treason of Judas is no less His own 
proper work than the vocation of Paul; let him be anathema. 
CANON VII.-If any one saith, that all works done before Justification, in whatsoever way 
they be done, are truly sins, or merit the hatred of God; or that the more earnestly one 
strives to dispose himself for grace, the more grievously he sins: let him be anathema. 
CANON VIII.-If any one saith, that the fear of hell,-whereby, by grieving for our sins, we 
flee unto the mercy of God, or refrain from sinning,-is a sin, or makes sinners worse; let 
him be anathema. 
CANON IX.-If any one saith, that by faith alone the impious is justified; in such wise as 
to mean, that nothing else is required to co-operate in order to the obtaining the grace of 
Justification, and that it is not in any way necessary, that he be prepared and disposed by 
the movement of his own will; let him be anathema. 
CANON X.-If any one saith, that men are just without the justice of Christ, whereby He 
merited for us to be justified; or that it is by that justice itself that they are formally just; 
let him be anathema. 
[Page 46] CANON XI.-If any one saith, that men are justified, either by the sole 
imputation of the justice of Christ, or by the sole remission of sins, to the exclusion of the 
grace and the charity which is poured forth in their hearts by the Holy Ghost, and is 
inherent in them; or even that the grace, whereby we are justified, is only the favour of 
God; let him be anathema. 
CANON XII.-If any one saith, that justifying faith is nothing else but confidence in the 
divine mercy which remits sins for Christ's sake; or, that this confidence alone is that 
whereby we are justified; let him be anathema. 
CANON XIII.-If any one saith, that it is necessary for every one, for the obtaining the 
remission of sins, that he believe for certain, and without any wavering arising from his 
own infirmity and disposition, that his sins are forgiven him; let him be anathema. 
CANON XIV.-If any one saith, that man is truly absolved from his sins and justified, 
because that he assuredly believed himself absolved and justified; or, that no one is truly 
justified but he who believes himself justified; and that, by this faith alone, absolution and 
justification are effected; let him be anathema. 
CANON XV.-If any one saith, that a man, who is born again and justified, is bound of 
faith to believe that he is assuredly in the number of the predestinate; let him be 
anathema. 
CANON XVI.-If any one saith, that he will for certain, of an absolute and infallible 
certainty, have that great gift of perseverance unto the end,-unless he have learned this by 
special revelation; let him be anathema. 
CANON XVII.-If any one saith, that the grace of Justification is only attained to by those 
who are predestined unto life; but that all others who are called, are called indeed, but 
receive not grace, as being, by the divine power, predestined unto evil; let him be 
anathema. 
CANON XVIII.-If any one saith, that the commandments of God are, even for one that is 
justified and constituted in grace, impossible to keep; let him be anathema. 
[Page 47] CANON XIX.-If any one saith, that nothing besides faith is commanded in the 
Gospel; that other things are indifferent, neither commanded nor prohibited, but free; or, 
that the ten commandments nowise appertain to Christians; let him be anathema. 
CANON XX.-If any one saith, that the man who is justified and how perfect soever, is not 
bound to observe the commandments of God and of the Church, but only to believe; as if 
indeed the Gospel were a bare and absolute promise of eternal life, without the condition 
of observing the commandments ; let him be anathema. 
CANON XXI.-If any one saith, that Christ Jesus was given of God to men, as a redeemer 
in whom to trust, and not also as a legislator whom to obey; let him be anathema. 
CANON XXII.-If any one saith, that the justified, either is able to persevere, without the 
special help of God, in the justice received; or that, with that help, he is not able; let him 
be anathema. 
CANON XXIII.-lf any one saith, that a man once justified can sin no more, nor lose 
grace, and that therefore he that falls and sins was never truly justified; or, on the other 
hand, that he is able, during his whole life, to avoid all sins, even those that are venial,
except by a special privilege from God, as the Church holds in regard of the Blessed 
Virgin; let him be anathema. 
CANON XXIV.-If any one saith, that the justice received is not preserved and also 
increased before God through good works; but that the said works are merely the fruits 
and signs of Justification obtained, but not a cause of the increase thereof; let him be 
anathema. 
CANON XXV.-If any one saith, that, in every good work, the just sins venially at least, 
or-which is more intolerable still-mortally, and consequently deserves eternal 
punishments; and that for this cause only he is not damned, that God does not impute 
those works unto damnation; let him be anathema. 
CANON XXVI.-If any one saith, that the just ought not, for their good works done in 
God, to expect and hope for an eternal recompense from God, through His mercy and the 
merit of Jesus Christ, if so be that they persevere to the end in well [Page 48] doing and in 
keeping the divine commandments; let him be anathema. 
CANON XXVII.-If any one saith, that there is no mortal sin but that of infidelity; or, that 
grace once received is not lost by any other sin, however grievous and enormous, save by 
that of infidelity ; let him be anathema. 
CANON XXVIII.-If any one saith, that, grace being lost through sin, faith also is always 
lost with it; or, that the faith which remains, though it be not a lively faith, is not a true 
faith; or, that he, who has faith without charity, is not a Chris taught; let him be anathema. 
CANON XXIX.-If any one saith, that he, who has fallen after baptism, is not able by the 
grace of God to rise again; or, that he is able indeed to recover the justice which he has 
lost, but by faith alone without the sacrament of Penance, contrary to what the holy 
Roman and universal Church-instructed by Christ and his Apostles-has hitherto professed, 
observed, and taugh; let him be anathema. 
CANON XXX.-If any one saith, that, after the grace of Justification has been received, to 
every penitent sinner the guilt is remitted, and the debt of eternal punishment is blotted 
out in such wise, that there remains not any debt of temporal punishment to be discharged 
either in this world, or in the next in Purgatory, before the entrance to the kingdom of 
heaven can be opened (to him); let him be anathema. 
CANON XXXI.-If any one saith, that the justified sins when he performs good works 
with a view to an eternal recompense; let him be anathema. 
CANON XXXII.-If any one saith, that the good works of one that is justified are in such 
manner the gifts of God, as that they are not also the good merits of him that is justified; 
or, that the said justified, by the good works which he performs through the grace of God 
and the merit of Jesus Christ, whose [Page 49] living member he is, does not truly merit 
increase of grace, eternal life, and the attainment of that eternal life,-if so be, however, 
that he depart in grace,-and also an increase of glory; let him be anathema. 
CANON XXXIII.-If any one saith,that,by the Catholic doctrine touching Justification, by 
this holy Synod inset forth in this present decree, the glory of God, or the merits of our 
Lord Jesus Christ are in any way derogated from, and not rather that the truth of our faith, 
and the glory in fine of God and of Jesus Christ are rendered (more) illustrious; let him be 
anathema. 
DECREE ON REFORMATION
 CHAPTER I.  
It is meet that prelates reside in their own churches; if they act otherwise, the penalties of 
the ancient law are renewed against them, and fresh penalties decreed. 
The same sacred and holy Synod,-the same legates of the Apostolic See presiding,
wishing to apply itself to restore ecclesiastical discipline, which is exceedingly relaxed, 
and to amend the depraved manners of the clergy and Christian people, has thought it fit 
to begin with those who preside over the greater churches; for the integrity of those who 
govern, is the safety of the governed. Trusting, therefore, that by the mercy of our Lord 
and God, and the provident vigilance of His own vicar on earth, it will surely for the 
future happen, that those who are most worthy,-and whose previous life, in every stage 
thereof, from their infancy to their riper years, having been laudably passed in the 
exercises of ecclesiastical discipline, bears testimony in their favour,-will be assumed 
unto the government of churches, in accordance with the venerable ordinances of the 
Fathers, for that it is a burthen whose weight would be formidable even unto angels: (the 
Synod) admonishes all those who, under whatsoever name and title, are set over any 
[Page 50] patriarchal, primatial, metropolitan, and cathedral churches, and hereby 
accounts all such admonished, that, taking heed to themselves, and to the whole flock, 
wherein the Holy Ghost hath placed them to rule the Church of God which he hath 
purchased with his own blood, they be vigilant, as the Apostle enjoins, that they labour in 
all things, and fulfil their ministry: but let them know, that fulfil it they cannot, if like 
hirelings they abandon the flocks committed to them, and apply not themselves to the 
keeping of their own sheep, whose blood will be required at their hands, by the Supreme 
Judge; seeing that it is most certain that, if the wolf have devoured the sheep, the 
shepherd's excuse will not be admitted, that he knew not thereof. 
And yet, for as much as some are to be found at this time, who-as is grievously to be 
lamented-forgetful even of their own salvation, and preferring earthly things to heavenly, 
and things human before divine, wander about in various courts, or, their fold forsaken, 
and the care of the sheep committed to them neglected, keep themselves occupied with 
the solicitudes of temporal affairs; it hath seemed good to the sacred and holy Synod to 
renew, as by virtue of the present decree It doth renew, the ancient canons promulgated 
against non-residents, which (canons) have, through the disorders of the times and of 
men, well nigh fallen into desuetude; and furthermore, in order to the more fixed 
residence of the same, and for the reforming of manners in the church, it hath seemed 
good to appoint and ordain in the manner following:-If any one, by whatsoever dignity, 
degree, and pre-eminence distinguished, shall, by remaining six months together out of 
his own diocese, all lawful impediment, or just and reasonable causes ceasing, be absent 
from a patriarchal, primatial, metropolitan, or cathedral church, under what title soever, 
cause, name, or right committed to him, he shall ipso jure incur the penalty of the 
forfeiture of a fourth part of one year's fruits, to be applied, by an ecclesiastical [Page 51] 
superior, to the fabric of the church and to the poor of the place. And if he continue absent 
in this way during six other months, he shall thereupon forfeit another fourth part of the 
fruits to be applied in like manner. But if the contumacy proceed yet further, the 
metropolitan shall, for the subjecting him to a severer censure of the sacred canons, be 
obliged to denounce his absent suffragan bishops, and the oldest resident suffragan bishop 
to denounce his absent metropolitan, to the Roman pontiff, either by letter or by 
messenger, within the space of three months, under the penalty, to be ipso facto incurred, 
of being interdicted from entering into the church; that he, by the authority of his own 
supreme See, may proceed against the said non-resident prelates, according as the greater 
or less contumacy of each may require, and provide the said churches with more useful 
pastors, as he shall know in the Lord to be salutary and expedient. 
CHAPTER II.  
It is not lawful for any one who holds a benefice requiring personal residence to absent 
himself, save for a just cause to be approved of by the bishop, who even then shall, for the 
cure of souls, substitute a vicar in his stead, withdrawing a portion of the fruits. 
Those inferior to bishops, who hold by title, or in commendam, any ecclesiastical 
benefices requiring personal residence whether by law or custom, shall be compelled, by 
their Ordinaries, to reside, by suitable legal remedies; as to them shall seem expedient for 
the good government of the churches and the advancement of the service of God, taking 
into account the character of the places and persons; and to no one shall any perpetual 
privileges, or indults, in favour of non-residence, or of receiving the fruits during absence, 
be of avail: temporary indulgences and dispensations, however, granted solely for true 
and reasonable causes, and which are to be legitimately proved before the Ordinary, shall 
remain in force; in which cases [Page 52] nevertheless, it shall be the office of bishops, as 
delegated in this matter by the Apostolic See, to provide that, by deputing competent 
vicars, and by assigning them a suitable portion of the fruits, the cure of souls be nowise 
neglected; no privilege or exemption whatever being of avail to any in this regard. 
CHAPTER III.  
The excesses of Secular clerics and of Regulars who live out of their monasteries, shall be 
corrected by the Ordinary of the place. 
The prelates of the churches shall apply themselves prudently and diligently to correct the 
excesses of their subjects; and no Secular cleric, under pretext of a personal privilege, or 
any Regular, living out of his monastery, shall, under pretext of a privilege of his order, 
be accounted, if he transgress, exempt from being visited, punished, and corrected, in 
accordance with the ordinances of the canons, by the Ordinary of the place, as being 
delegated hereunto by the Apostolic See. 
CHAPTER IV.  
Bishops and other greater prelates shall visit any churches whatsoever, as often as there 
shall be need; everything which might hinder this decree being abrogated. 
The Chapters of cathedral, and of other greater, churches, and the members thereof, shall 
not be able,-by any exemptions, customs, judgments, oaths, concordates, which only bind 
the authors thereof and not also their successors,-to screen themselves from being capable 
of being, in accordance with the ordinances of the canons, visited, corrected, and 
amended, as often as shall be needful, even with apostolical authority, by their own 
bishops, and other greater prelates, by themselves alone, or with those whom they shall 
see fit to have accompany them. 
[Page 53] 
CHAPTER V.  
Bishops shall neither exercise any pontifical function, nor ordain, in another diocese. 
It shall not be lawful for any bishop, under the plea of any privilege soever, to exercise 
pontifical functions in the diocese of another, save by the express permission of the 
Ordinary of the place, and in regard to those persons only who are subject to that same 
Ordinary: if the contrary shall have been done, the bishop shall be ipso facto suspended 
from the exercise of episcopal functions, and those so ordained (be similarly suspended) 
from the exercise of their orders. 
INDICTION OF THE NEXT SESSION 
Doth it please you, that the next ensuing Session be celebrated on Thursday, the fifth day 
after the first Sunday of the approaching Lent, which (Thursday) will be the third day of 
the month of March? They answered: It pleaseth us.

DECREE ON THE SACRAMENTS
 Proem. 
For the completion of the salutary doctrine on Justification, which was promulgated with 
the unanimous consent of the Fathers in the last preceding Session, it hath seemed 
suitable to treat of the most holy Sacraments of the Church, through which all true justice 
either begins, or being begun is increased, or being lost is repaired. With this view, in 
order to destroy the errors and to extirpate the heresies, which have appeared [Page 54] in 
these our days on the subject of the said most holy sacraments,-as well those which have 
been revived from the heresies condemned of old by our Fathers, as also those newly 
invented, and which are exceedingly prejudicial to the purity of the Catholic Church, and 
to the salvation of souls,-the sacred and holy, oecumenical and general Synod of Trent, 
lawfully assembled in the Holy Ghost, the same legates of the Apostolic See presiding 
therein, adhering to the doctrine of the holy Scriptures, to the apostolic traditions, and to 
the consent of other councils and of the Fathers, has thought fit that these present canons 
be established and decreed; intending, the divine Spirit aiding, to publish later the 
remaining canons which are wanting for the completion of the work which It has begun. 
ON THE SACRAMENTS IN GENERAL
 CANON I.-If any one saith, that the sacraments of the New Law were not all instituted by 
Jesus Christ, our Lord; or, that they are more, or less, than seven, to wit, Baptism, 
Confirmation, the Eucharist, Penance, Extreme Unction, Order, and Matrimony; or even 
that any one of these seven is not truly and properly a sacrament; let him be anathema. 
CANON II.-If any one saith, that these said sacraments of the New Law do not differ 
from the sacramnets of the Old Law, save that the ceremonies are different, and different 
the outward rites; let him be anathema. 
CANON III.-If any one saith, that these seven sacraments are in such wise equal to each 
other, as that one is not in any way more worthy than another; let him be anathema. 
CANON IV.-If any one saith, that the sacraments of the New Law are not necessary unto 
salvation, but superfluous; and that, without them, or without the desire thereof, men 
obtain of God, through faith alone, the grace of justification;-though all (the sacraments) 
are not ineed necessary for every individual; let him be anathema. 
CANON V.-If any one saith, that these sacraments were instituted for the sake of 
nourishing faith alone; let him be anathema. 
[Page 55] CANON VI.-If any one saith, that the sacraments of the New Law do not 
contain the grace which they signify; or, that they do not confer that grace on those who 
do not place an obstacle thereunto; as though they were merely outward signs of grace or 
justice received through faith, and certain marks of the Christian profession, whereby 
believers are distinguished amongst men from unbelievers; let him be anathema. 
CANON VII.-If any one saith, that grace, as far as God's part is concerned, is not given 
through the said sacraments, always, and to all men, even though they receive them 
rightly, but (only) sometimes, and to some persons; let him be anathema. 
CANON VIII.-If any one saith, that by the said sacraments of the New Law grace is not 
conferred through the act performed, but that faith alone in the divine promise suffices for 
the obtaining of grace; let him be anathema. 
CANON IX.-If any one saith, that, in the three sacrments, Baptism, to wit, Confirmation, 
and Order, there is not imprinted in the soul a character, that is, a certain spiritual and 
indelible Sign, on account of which they cannot be repeated; let him be anathema. 
CANON X.-If any one saith, that all Christians have power to administer the word, and 
all the sacraments; let him be anathema. 
CANON XI.-If any one saith, that, in ministers, when they effect, and confer the 
sacraments, there is not required the intention at least of doing what the Church does; let 
him be anathema. 
CANON XII.-If any one saith, that a minister, being in mortal sin,-if so be that he observe 
all the essentials which belong to the effecting, or conferring of, the sacrament,-neither 
effects, nor confers the sacrament; let him be anathema. 
CANON XIII.-If any one saith, that the received and approved rites of the Catholic 
Church, wont to be used in the solemn [Page 56] administration of the sacraments, may 
be contemned, or without sin be omitted at pleasure by the ministers, or be changed, by 
every pastor of the churches, into other new ones; let him be anathema. 
ON BAPTISM
 CANON I.-If any one saith, that the baptism of John had the same force as the baptism of 
Christ; let him be anathema. 
CANON II.-If any one saith, that true and natural water is not of necessity for baptism, 
and, on that account, wrests, to some sort of metaphor, those words of our Lord Jesus 
Christ; Unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost; let him be anathema. 
CANON III.-If any one saith, that in the Roman church, which is the mother and mistress 
of all churches, there is not the true doctrine concerning the sacrament of baptism; let him 
be anathema. 
CANON IV.-If any one saith, that the baptism which is even given by heretics in the 
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, with the intention of doing 
what the Church doth, is not true baptism; let him be anathema. 
CANON V.-If any one saith, that baptism is free, that is, not necessary unto salvation; let 
him be anathema. 
CANON VI.-If any one saith, that one who has been baptized cannot, even if he would, 
lose grace, let him sin ever so much, unless he will not believe; let him be anathema. 
CANON VII.-If any one saith, that the baptized are, by baptism itself, made debtors but to 
faith alone, and not to the observance of the whole law of Christ; let him be anathema. 
CANON VIII.-If any one saith, that the baptized are freed from all the precepts, whether 
written or transmitted, of holy Church, in such wise that they are not bound to observe 
them, unless they have chosen of their own accord to submit themselves thereunto; let 
him be anathema. 
[Page 57] CANON IX.-If any one saith, that the resemblance of the baptism which they 
have received is so to be recalled unto men, as that they are to understand, that all vows 
made after baptism are void, in virtue of the promise already made in that baptism; as if, 
by those vows, they both derogated from that faith which they have professed, and from 
that baptism itself; let him be anathema. 
CANON X.-If any one saith, that by the sole remembrance and the faith of the baptism 
which has been received, all sins committed after baptism are either remitted, or made 
venial; let him be anathema. 
CANON XI.-If any one saith, that baptism, which was true and rightly conferred, is to be 
repeated, for him who has denied the faith of Christ amongst Infidels, when he is 
converted unto penitence; let him be anathema. 
CANON XII.-If any one saith, that no one is to be baptized save at that age at which 
Christ was baptized, or in the very article of death; let him be anathema. 
CANON XIII.-If any one saith, that little children, for that they have not actual faith, are 
not, after having received baptism, to be reckoned amongst the faithful; and that, for this 
cause, they are to be rebaptized when they have attained to years of discretion; or, that it 
is better that the baptism of such be omitted, than that, while not believing by their own 
act, they should be bapized in the faith alone of the Church; let him be anathema. 
CANON XIV.-If any one saith, that those who have been thus baptized when children, 
are, when they have grown up, to be asked whether they will ratify what their sponsors 
promised in their names when they were baptized; and that, in case they answer that they 
will not, they are to be left to their own will; and are not to be compelled meanwhile to a 
Christian life by any other penalty, save that they be excluded from the participation of 
the Eucharist, and of the other sacraments, until they repent; let him be anathema. 
[Page 58] 
ON CONFIRMATION
 CANON I.-If any one saith, that the confirmation of those who have been baptized is an 
idle ceremony, and not rather a true and proper sacrament; or that of old it was nothing 
more than a kind of catechism, whereby they who were near adolescence gave an account 
of their faith in the face of the Church; let him be anathema. 
CANON II.-If any one saith, that they who ascribe any virtue to the sacred chrism of 
confirmation, offer an outrage to the Holy Ghost; let him be anathema. 
CANON III.-If any one saith, that the ordinary minister of holy confirmation is not the 
bishop alone, but any simple priest soever; let him be anathema. 
DECREE ON REFORMATION
 The same sacred and holy Synod, the same legates also presiding, purposing to prosecute, 
unto the praise of God, and the increase of the Christian religion, the work which It hath 
begun touching residence and reformation, has thought good to ordain as follows,-saving 
always, in all things, the authority of the Apostolic See. 
CHAPTER I.  
Who is capable of governing Cathedral churches. 
No one shall be assumed unto the government of Cathedral churches, but one that is born 
of lawful wedlock, is of mature age, and endowed with gravity of manners, and skill in 
letters, agreeably to the constitution of Alexander III., which begins, Cum in cunctis, 
promulgated in the Council of Lateran. 
[Page 59] 
CHAPTER II.  
The holders of several Cathedral churches are commanded to resign all but one, in a given 
manner and time. 
No one, by whatsoever dignity, grade, or pre-eminence distinguished, shall presume, in 
contravention of the institutes of the sacred canons, to accept and to hold at the same time 
several Metropolitan, or Cathedral, churches, whether by title, or in commendam, or 
under any other name whatsoever; seeing that he is to be accounted exceedingly fortunate 
whose lot it is to rule one church well and fruitfully, and unto the salvation of the souls 
committed to him. But as to those who now hold several churches contrary to the tenor of 
the present decree, they shall be bound, retaining the one which they may prefer, to resign 
the rest, within six months if they are at the free disposal of the Apostolic See, in other 
cases within the year; otherwise those churches, the one last obtained only excepted, shall 
be from that moment deemed vacant. 
CHAPTER III. 
Benefices shall be conferred solely on capable individuals. 
Inferior Ecclesiastical Benefices, especially such as have the cure of souls, shall be 
conferred on persons worthy and capable, and who can reside on the spot and exercise 
personally the said cure; in accordance with the Constitution of Alexander IIl., in the 
Council of Lateran, which begins, Quia nonnulli; and that other of Gregory X., published 
in the General Council of Lyons, which begins, Licet Canon. A collation, or provision, 
made otherwise, shall be wholly annulled: and let the ordinary collator know, that he will 
himself incur the penalties set down in the Constitution of the General Council (of 
Lateran), which begins, Grave nimis. 
[Page 60] 
CHAPTER IV.  
The retainer of several Benefices contrary to the Canons, shall be deprived thereof. 
Whosoever shall for the future presume to accept, or to retain at the same time several 
cures, or otherwise incompatible Ecclesiastical Benefices, whether by way of union for 
life, or in perpetual commendam, or under any other name or title whatsoever, in 
contravention of the appointment of the sacred Canons, and especially of the Constitution 
of Innocent III., beginning, De multa, shall be ipso jure deprived of the said benefices, 
according to the disposition of the said constitution, and also by virtue of the present 
Canon. 
CHAPTER V. 
The holders of several Benefices with cure of souls shall exhibit their dispensations to the 
Ordinary, who shall provide the churches with a Vicar, assigning a suitable portion of the 
fruits. 
The Ordinaries of the places shall strictly compel all those who hold several cures, or 
otherwise incompatible, Ecclesiastical Benefices to exhibit their dispensations; and they 
shall otherwise proceed according to the Constitution of Gregory X., published in the 
General Council of Lyons, beginning Ordinarii, which (Constitution) this holy Synod 
thinks ought to be renewed, and doth renew; adding further, that the said Ordinaries are 
by all means to provide, even by deputing fit vicars and by assigning a suitable portion of 
the fruits, that the cure of souls be not in any way neglected, and that the said benfices be 
nowise defrauded of the services due to them: no appeals, privileges, or exemptions 
whatsoever, even with a commission of special judges, and inhibitions from the same, 
being of avail to any one in the matters aforenamed. 
[Page 61] 
CHAPTER VI.  
What unions of Benefices shall be accounted valid. 
Unions in perpetuity, made within forty years, may be examined into by the Ordinaries, as 
delegated by the Apostolic See, and such as shall have been obtained by surreption or 
obreption shall be declared null. Now those are to be presumed to have been 
surreptitiously obtained, which having been granted within the aforenamed period, have 
not as yet been carried into effect wholly, or in part, as also those which shall henceforth 
be made at the instance of any person soever, unless it shall be certain that they have been 
made for lawful, or otherwise reasonable causes, which are to be verified before the 
Ordinary of the place, those persons being summoned whose interests are concerned: and 
therefore (such unions) shall be altogether of no force, unless the Apostolic See shall have 
declared otherwise. 
CHAPTER VII.  
United Ecclesiastical Benefices shall be visited: the cure thereof shall be exercised even 
by perpetual vicars; who shall be deputed thereunto with a portion, to be assigned even 
upon a specific property. 
Ecclesiastical Benefices with cures, which are found to have been always united and 
annexed to Cathedral, Collegiate, or other churches, or to monasteries, benefices, 
colleges, or other pious places of what sort soever, shall be visited every year by the 
Ordinaries of those places; who shall apply themselves sedulously to provide that the cure 
of souls be laudably exercised by competent vicars, and those even perpetual, unless the 
said Ordinaries shall deem it expedient for the good of the churches that it be otherwise,
which (vicars) shall be deputed thereunto by those Ordinaries, with a provision consisting 
of a third part of the fruits, or of a greater or less proportion, at the discretion [Page 62] of 
the said Ordinaries, which (portion) is to be assigned even upon a specific property; no 
appeals, privileges, exemptions, even with a commission of judges, and inhibitions from 
the same, being of any avail in the matters abovenamed. 
CHAPTER VIII.  
Churches shall be repaired: the cure of souls sedulously discharged. 
The Ordinaries of the places shall be bound to visit every year, with apostolic authority, 
all churches whatsoever, in whatsoever manner exempted; and to provide by suitable 
legal remedies that whatever needs repairs, be repaired; and that those churches be not in 
any way defrauded of the Cure of souls, if such be annexed thereunto, or of other services 
due to them;-all appeals, privileges, customs, even those that have a prescription from 
time immemorial, commission of judges, and inhibitions from the same, being utterly set 
aside. 
CHAPTER IX.  
The duty of consecration not to be delayed. 
Those who have been promoted to the greater churches shall receive the rite of 
consecration within the time prescribed by law, and any delays granted, extending beyond 
the period of six months, shall be of no avail to any one. 
CHAPTER X.  
When a See is vacant, Chapters shall not grant 'reverends' to any unless straitened because 
of a Benefice obtained, or about to be obtained: various penalties on contraveners. 
It shall not be lawful for Chapters of churches, when a see is vacant, to grant,-whether by 
ordinance of common law, or by virtue of any privilege or custom whatsoever,-a license 
for [Page 63] ordination, or letters dimissory, or "reverend," as some call them, within a 
year from the day of that vacancy, to any one who is not straitened (for time), by occasion 
of some ecclesistical benefice received, or about to be received. Otherwise, the 
contravening Chapter shall be subjected to an ecclesiastical interdict; and the persons so 
ordained, if they have been constituted in minor orders, shall not enjoy any clerical 
privilege, especially in criminal causes; whilst those constituted in the greater orders shall 
be, ipso jure, suspended from the exercise thereof, during the pleasure of the next 
appointed prelate. 
CHAPTER XI.  
Faculties for promotion shall not avail any one without a just cause. 
Faculties, for being promoted (to orders) by any prelate whatsoever, shall be of no avail 
but to those who have a lawful cause-which is to be expressed in their letters-why they 
cannot be ordained by their own bishops; and even then they shall not be ordained but by 
a bishop who is resident in his own diocese, or by him who exercises the pontifical 
functions for him, and after having undergone a previous careful examination. 
CHAPTER XII.  
Faculties for not being promoted shall not exceed a year. 
Faculties granted for not being promoted (to orders) shall avail for a year only, except in 
the cases by law provided. 
[Page 64] 
CHAPTER XIII.  
Individuals by whomsoever presented shall not be instituted without being previously 
examined and approved of by the Ordinary; with certain exceptions. 
Persons presented, or elected, or nominated by any ecclesiastics soever, even by Nuncios 
of the Apostolic See, shall not be instituted, or confirmed in, or admitted to any 
ecclesiastical benefices whatsoever, even under the plea of any privilege soever, or 
custom, which may even have a prescription from time immemorial, unless they shall 
have been first examined, and found fit, by the Ordinaries of the places. And no one shall 
be able to screen himself, by means of an appeal, from being bound to undergo that 
examination. Those, however, are to be excepted, who are presented, elected, or 
nominated by universities, or by colleges for general studies. 
CHAPTER XIV.  
The civil causes of exempted persons which may be taken cognizance of by bishops. 
In the causes of exempted persons, the Constitution of Innocent IV., beginning Volentes, 
set forth in the general Council of Lyons, shall be observed,-which Constitution this 
sacred and holy Synod hath thought ought to be renewed, and doth hereby renew it; 
adding further, that, in civil causes relative to wages, and to persons in distress, clerics, 
whether Seculars, or Regulars who live out of their monasteries,-howsoever exempted, 
and even though they may have upon the spot a special judge deputed by the Apostolic 
See; and in other causes, if they have no such judge,-may be brought before the 
Ordinaries of the places, and be constrained and compelled by course of law to [Page 65] 
pay what they owe; no privileges, exemptions, commissions of conservators, and 
inhibitions therefrom, being of any force whatever in opposition to the (regulations) 
aforesaid. 
CHAPTER XV.  
Ordinaries shall take care that all manner of hospitals, even those exempted, be faithfully 
governed by their adminstrators. 
The Ordinaries shall take care that all hospitals whatsoever be faithfully and diligently 
governed by their own administrators, by what names soever called, and in what way 
soever exempted: observing herein the form of the Constitution of the Council of Vienne, 
which begins, Quia contingit, which this holy Synod hath thought fit to renew, and doth 
hereby renew, together with the derogations therein contained. 
INDICTION OF THE NEXT SESSION
 This sacred and holy Synod hath also resolved and decreed that the next ensuing Session 
be held and celebrated on Thursday, the fifth day after the coming Sunday in Albis (Low 
Sunday), which will be the twenty-first of the month of April of the present year, 
MDXLVII. 
BULL WITH FACULTY TO TRANFER THE COUNCIL
 Paul, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to our venerable brother Giammaria, bishop 
of Palaestrina, and to our beloved sons, Marcellus of the title of the Holy Cross in 
Jerusalem, priest, and Reginald of Saint Mary in Cosmedin, deacon, cardinals, our 
Legates, a latere, and those of the Apostolic See, health and apostolical benediction. 
We, by the providence of God, presiding over the government of the universal Church, 
though with merits unequal thereunto, account it a part of our office that, if anything of 
more than common moment have to be settled touching the Christian [Page 66] 
commonweal, it be done not only at a suitable season, but also in a convenient and fit 
place. Wherefore, whereas We lately, with the advice and consent of our venerable 
brethren the cardinals of the holy Roman Church,-upon hearing that peace had been made 
between our most dear sons in Christ, Charles the Emperor of the Romans, ever august, 
and Francis the most Christian King of the French,-took off and removed the suspension 
of the celebration of the sacred oecumenical and universal Council, which we had on 
another occasion, for reasons then stated, indicted with the advice and consent aforesaid, 
for the city of Trent, and which was, for certain other reasons at that time also named, 
suspended, upon the like advice and consent, unto another more opportune and suitable 
time to be declared by us: being ourselves unable, from being at that time lawfully 
hindered, to repair to the above-named city in person, and to be present at that Council, 
We, by the same advice, appointed and deputed you as Legates a latere on our behalf and 
that of the Apostolic See, in that Council; and we sent you unto that same city as angels of 
peace, as in divers our letters thereupon is more fully set forth: wishing to provide 
seasonably that so holy a work as the celebration of such a Council may not be hindered 
through the incommodiousness of the place, or otherwise in any other manner, We, of our 
proper motion, and certain knowledge, and the plenitude of apostolic authority, and with 
the advice and consent aforesaid, by the tenor of these presents do, with apostolic 
authority, concede to you all together, or to two of you, upon the other being detained by 
a lawful impediment, or maybe absent therefrom, full and unrestrained power and faculty, 
to transfer and change, when soever you shall see cause, the aforesaid Council from the 
city of Trent to any other more Convenient, suitable, or safe City, as to you shall seem fit, 
and to suppress and dissolve that which is held in the said city of Trent; as also to 
prohibit, even under ecclesiastical pains and censures, the prelates and other members of 
the said Council, from proceeding to any further measures therein in the said sity of Trent; 
and also to continue, hold, and celebrate the same Council in the other city as aforesaid 
unto which it shall have been transferred and changed, and [Page 67] to summon 
thereunto the prelates and other members of the said Council of Trent, even under the 
pain of perjury and of the other penalties named in the letters of Indiction of that Council; 
to preside and proceed, in the Council thus translated and changed, in the name and by the 
authority aforesaid, and to perform, regulate, ordain, and execute the other things 
mentioned above, and the things thereunto necessary and suitable in accordance with the 
contents and tenor of the previous letters which have been on other occasion addressed 
unto you: declaring that We will hold as ratified and pleasing whatsoever by you shall 
have been done, regulated, ordained, in the matters aforesaid, and will, with God's help, 
cause it to be inviolably observed; any apostolical Constitutions and ordinances, and other 
things whatsoever to the contrary notwithstanding. Wherefore, let no one soever infringe 
this letter of our grant, or with rash daring go contrary thereto. But if any one shall 
presume to attempt this, let him know that he will incur the indignation of Almighty God, 
and of the blessed Peter and Paul, His apostles. 
Given at Rome, at St. Peter's, in the year of the Lord's Incarnation MDXLVII, on the 
eighth of the calends of March, in the eleventh year of our Pontificate.

SESSION THE EIGHTH,
 Celebrated on the eleventh day of the month of March, in the year MDXLVII. 
DECREE CONCERNING THE TRANSLATION OF THE COUNCIL
 Doth it please you to decree and declare, that, from the foregoing statements and other 
allegations, a disease of the kind stated is so plainly and notoriously certain, that the 
prelates cannot without danger of their lives remain in this city, and that [Page 68] 
therefore they cannot and ought not to be detained therein against their wills? And 
considering moreover the withdrawal of many prelates since the Session last held, and the 
protests made in the general congregations by very many other prelates, who wish by all 
means to depart hence through fear of the said disease, who cannot justly be detained; and 
by whose departure the Council would either be dissolved, or, from the small number of 
the prelates, its beneficial progress be hindered; and considering also the imminent danger 
to life, and the other notoriously true and legitimate reasons alleged in the said 
congregations by certain of the Fathers; doth it please you, in like manner, to decree and 
declare, that, for the preservation and prosecution of the said Council, and for the safety 
of the lives of the said prelates, this Council be transferred for a time to the city of 
Bologna, as being a place better provided, more healthy, and fit, and that the translation 
have effect from this day forth, and that the Session, already indicted for the twentyfirst of 
April ought to be celebrated, and be celebrated, there on that appointed day; and that the 
further matters be proceeded with in order, until it shall seem expedient, to our most holy 
Lord and to the sacred Council, that the said Council may, and ought to, be brought back 
to this, or to some other place, taking council also thereupon with the most invincible 
Emperor, the most Christian king, and with the other Christian kings and princes? They 
answered: It pleaseth us.

SESSION THE NINTH,
 Celebrated at Bologna, on the twenty-first day of the month of April, MDXLVII. 
DECREE FOR THE PROROGATION OF THE SESSION
 This sacred and holy, ecumenical and general Synod, which lately was assembled in the 
city of Trent, and is now lawfully assembled in the Holy Ghost at Bologna, the same most 
reverend Lords Giammaria del Monte, bishop of Palaestrina, and Marcellus, of the title of 
the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, priest, [Page 69] cardinals of the holy Roman Church, and 
Legates apostolic a latere, presiding therein in the name of our most holy Father in Christ, 
and Lord, Paul III., by the providence of God, Pope; considering that, on the eleventh day 
of the month of March of the present year, in a general and public Session celebrated in 
the said city of Trent, in the usual place, all the formalities being observed in the usual 
manner; (the Synod) ,-for causes then pressing, urgent, and legitimate, and with the 
interposition also of the authority of the holy Apostolic See, specially also granted to the 
said most reverend Presidents,-decreed and ordained, that the Council was to be 
transferred, as it did transfer it, from that place to this city, and likewise that the Session,
indicted there for this twenty-first day of April, that Canons touching the matters of the 
Sacraments and of Reformation, whereon It had purposed to treat, might be established 
and promulgated,-ought to be celebrated in this city of Bologna; and considering that 
some of the Fathers who have been accustomed to be present at this Council,-being some 
engaged in their own Churches during these last days of the great week (of Lent), and of 
the Paschal solemnity, and some also detained by other hindrances, -have not as yet come 
hither, but who nevertheless, it is to be hoped, will shortly be present; and that, from this 
cause, it has happened that the said matters of the Sacraments and of Reformation could 
not be examined and discussed in an assembly of prelates as numerous as the holy Synod 
desired: wherefore, to the end that all things may be done with mature deliberation, with 
due dignity and gravity, (the Synod) hath resolved, and doth resolve, that it is good, 
opportunie, and expedient, that the aforenamed Session, which, as has been said, was to 
have been celebrated on this day, be deferred and prorogued, as it is now deferred and 
prorogued, to the Thursday within the approaching octave of Pentecost, for the expediting 
of the matters aforesaid; which day It has deemed, and deems, to be most opportune for 
the business to be transacted, and most convenient especially for the Fathers who are 
absent; adding however, that this holy Synod may and can, even in a private 
congregation, limit and abridge the said term, at Its will and pleasure, as It shall think 
expedient for the business of the Council.

SESSION THE TENTH,
 Celebrated at Bologna on the second day of the month of June, MDXLVII. 
DECREE FOR THE PROROGATION OF THE SESSION
 Although this sacred and holy, oecumenical and general Synod hath decreed, that the 
Session which was to have been celebrated, in this illustrious city of Bologna, on the 
twenty-first day of the month of April last, on the subject of the Sacraments and of 
Reformation, in accordance with the decree promulgated in public Session in the city of 
Trent, should be deferred and prorogued to this present day, for certain reasons, and 
especially on account of the absence of some of the Fathers, who it was hoped would in a 
short time be present; wishing, however, even yet to deal kindly with those who have not 
come, the same sacred and holy Synod, lawfully assembled in the Holy Ghost, the same 
cardinals of the holy Roman Church, and Legates of the Apostolic See, presiding therein, 
resolves and decrees, that the said Session, which It had decreed to celebrate on this the 
second day of the month of June of this present year 1547, be deferred and prorogued, and 
It doth hereby defer and prorogue it, to the Thursday after the feast of the Nativity of the 
Blessed Virgin Mary, which will be the fifteenth of September next; for the expediting of 
the aforesaid and other matters; yet so, however, that the prosecution of the discussion 
and examination, as well of those things which relate to dogmas, as of those which regard 
reformation, shall not meanwhile be suspended; and that the said holy Synod freely may 
and can, at Its will and pleasure, even in a private congregation, abridge or prorogue the 
said term. 
On the fourteenth day of September, MDXLVII, in a general Congregation held at 
Bologna, the Session, which was to have been held on the following day, was prorogued 
during the good pleasure of the sacred Council. 
[Page 71] 
BULL FOR THE RESUMPTION OF THE COUNCIL OF TRENT, UNDER THE 
SOVEREIGN PONTIFF, JULIUS III 
Julius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, for the future memory hereof. 
Whereas, in order to remove the dissensions touching our religion, which for a long time 
have prevailed in Germany to the disturbance and scandal of the whole Christian world, it 
seems good, opportune, and expedient,-as also our most dearly beloved son in Christ, 
Charles the Emperor of the Romans, ever august, has caused to be signified to us by his 
letters and ambassadors,-to bring back to the city of Trent, the sacred, oecumenical, (and) 
general Council indicted by our predecessor, Pope Paul III., of happy memory, and begun, 
regulated, and continued, by Us, who then enjoyed the honour of the Cardinalate, and 
conjointly with two other Cardinals of the holy Roman Church, presided in the name of 
our said predecessor, in the said Council, wherein several public and solemn Sessions 
were held, and several decrees promulgated as well on the subject of faith as of 
Reformation, and also many things relating to both subjects examined and discussed;-We,
unto whom, as Sovereign Pontiff for the time, it appertains to indict and direct general 
Councils,-that we may, unto the praise and glory of Almighty God, procure the peace of 
the Church and the increase of the Christian faith and of the orthodox religion, and may, 
as far as in us lies, consult with fatherly care for the tranquillity of Germany,-a province 
indeed which, in times past, was never second to any in Christendom, in cultivating true 
religion, and the doctrine of the sacred Councils and holy Fathers, and in exhibiting due 
obedience and reverence to the chief Pontiffs, the vicars on earth of Christ our Redeemer; 
hoping that, by the grace and bounty of God, all Christian kings and princes will approve 
of, favour and aid our just and pious wishes herein: We, by the bowels of the mercy of our 
Lord Jesus Christ, exhort, require, and admonish our venerable brethren the patri-[Page 
72]archs, archbishops, bishops, and our beloved sons the abbots, and all and each of the 
others, who of right, or custom, or privilege, ought to be present at General Councils, and 
whom our said predecessor, in his letters of indiction and any others soever made and 
published on this subject, willed to be present at the Council, to convene and assemble, 
where there is no lawful impediment, in the same city of Trent, and to apply themselves 
without any delay whatever to the continuation and prosecution of the said Council, on 
the next ensuing calends of May, which day we appoint, determine on, and assign, after 
mature deliberation, and of our own certain knowledge, and the plenitude of apostolic 
authority, and with the advice and consent of our venerable brethren the Cardinals of the 
said holy Roman Church, for resuming and prosecuting the said Council in the state 
wherein it now is. For We shall make it our special care, that, at the same time, in the said 
city, there be always present our Legates, through whom,-if we shall be unable, on 
account of our age, state of health, and the necessities of the Apostolic See, to be 
personally present,-we shall, under the guidance of the Holy Ghost, preside over the said 
Council; any translation and suspension of the said Council, and any other things 
whatsoever to the contrary notwithstanding, and especially those things which it was the 
will of our predecessor should not create any obstacle, as expressed in his letters 
aforesaid, which, with all and each of the clauses and decrees therein contained, we will 
and decree to continue in force, and we do, as far as there is need thereof, hereby renew 
them; declaring moreover null and void whatsoever may be attempted, wittingly or 
ignorantly, by whatsoever person, or by whatsoever authority, against these presents. Let 
no one, therefore, infringe this our letter of exhortation, requisition, monition, statute, 
declaration, renewal, will, and decree, or with rash daring go contrary thereunto. But if 
any one shall presume to attempt this, let him know that he will incur the indignation of 
Almighty God, and of His blessed apostles, Peter and Paul.

SESSION THE TWELFTH,
 Being the second under the Sovereign Pontiff, Julius III., celebrated on the first day of 
September, MDLI. 
The sacred and holy, oecumenical and general Synod of Trent,-lawfully assembled in the 
Holy Ghost, the same Legate and nuncios of the Apostolic See presiding therein,-having, 
in [Page 74] the Session last held, decreed, that this next Session was to be on this day 
celebrated, and that further matters were to be proceeded with; whereas It has hitherto 
delayed to proceed, on account of the absence of the illustrious German nation,-whose 
interests are principally concerned,-and on account of the assemblage of the Fathers not 
being numerous; now rejoicing in the Lord, and giving deserved thanks to that same 
Almighty God, for the arrival, a little before this day, of our venerable brethren and sons 
in Christ, the Archbishops of Mayence and Treves,-electoral princes of the holy Roman 
Empire,-and also of several other bishops of that country and of other provinces; and 
conceiving a firm hope that very many other prelates, both of Germany and of other 
nations, will, impelled by the requirements of their office and by this example, in a few 
days arrive; (the Synod) indicts the next session for the fortieth day from this present, 
which will be the eleventh of October next:-and prosecuting the said Council in the state 
wherein it now is, whereas in the preceding Sessions decrees were passed touching the 
seven sacraments of the New Law in general, and on baptism and confirmation in 
particular, It resolves and decrees, that It will discuss and treat of the sacrament of the 
most holy Eucharist, and also, as regards Reformation, of the other matters which relate to 
the more easy and commodious residence of prelates. And It admonishes and exhorts all 
the Fathers, that, after the example of our Lord Jesus Christ, they meanwhile give 
themselves to fasting and prayer, so far at least as human weakness will permit, that so 
God, who is blessed for evermore, being at length appeased, may vouchsafe to bring back 
the hearts of men to the acknowledgment of His own true faith, to the unity of holy 
mother Church, and to the rule of righteous living.

SESSION THE THIRTEENTH,
 Being the third under the Sovereign Pontiff, Julius III., celebrated on the eleventh day of 
October, MDLI. 
DECREE CONCERNING THE MOST HOLY SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST
 The sacred and holy, oecumenical and general Synod of Trent,-lawfully assembled in the 
Holy Ghost, the same Legate, and nuncios of the Apostolic See presiding therein, 
although the end for which It assembled, not without the special guidance and governance 
of the Holy Ghost, was, that It might set forth the true and ancient doctrine touching faith 
and the sacraments, and might apply a remedy to all the heresies, and the other most 
grievous troubles with which the Church of God is now miserably agitated, and rent into 
many and various parts; yet, even from the outset, this especially has been the object of Its 
desires, that It might pluck up by the roots those tares of execrable errors and schisms, 
with which the enemy hath, in these our calamitous times, oversown the doctrine of the 
faith, in the use and worship of the sacred and holy Eucharist, which our Saviour, 
notwithstanding, left in His Church as a symbol of that unity and charity, with which He 
would fain have all Christians be mentally joined and united together. Wherefore, this 
sacred and holy Synod delivering here, on this venerable and divine sacrament of the 
Eucharist, that sound and genuine doctrine, which the Catholic Church,-instructed by our 
Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and by His apostles, and taught by the Holy Ghost, who day 
by day brings to her mind all truth, has always retained, and will preserve even to the end 
of the world, forbids all the faithful of Christ, to presume to believe, teach, or preach 
henceforth concerning the holy Eucharist, otherwise than as is explained and defined in 
this present decree. 
[Page 76] 
CHAPTER I.  
On the real presence of our Lord Jesus Christ in the most holy sacrament of the Eucharist. 
In the first place, the holy Synod teaches, and openly and simply professes, that, in the 
august sacrament of the holy Eucharist, after the consecration of the bread and wine, our 
Lord Jesus Christ, true God and man, is truly, really, and substantially contained under the 
species of those sensible things. For neither are these things mutually repugnant,-that our 
Saviour Himself always sitteth at the right hand of the Father in heaven, according to the 
natural mode of existing, and that, nevertheless, He be, in many other places, 
sacramentally present to us in his own substance, by a manner of existing, which, though 
we can scarcely express it in words, yet can we, by the understanding illuminated by faith, 
conceive, and we ought most firmly to believe, to be possible unto God: for thus all our 
forefathers, as many as were in the true Church of Christ, who have treated of this most 
holy Sacrament, have most openly professed, that our Redeemer instituted this so 
admirable a sacrament at the last supper, when, after the blessing of the bread and wine, 
He testified, in express and clear words, that He gave them His own very Body, and His 
own Blood; words which,-recorded by the holy Evangelists, and afterwards repeated by 
Saint Paul, whereas they carry with them that proper and most manifest meaning in which 
they were understood by the Fathers,-it is indeed a crime the most unworthy that they 
should be wrested, by certain contentions and wicked men, to fictitious and imaginary 
tropes, whereby the verity of the flesh and blood of Christ is denied, contrary to the 
universal sense of the Church, which, as the pillar and ground of truth, has detested, as 
satanical, these inventions devised by impious men; she recognising, with a mind ever 
grateful and unforgetting, this most excellent benefit of Christ. 
[Page 77] 
CHAPTER II.  
On the reason of the Institution of this most holy Sacrament. 
Wherefore, our Saviour, when about to depart out of this world to the Father, instituted 
this Sacrament, in which He poured forth as it were the riches of His divine love towards 
man, making a remembrance of his wonderful works; and He commanded us, in the 
participation thereof, to venerate His memory, and to show forth his death until He come 
to judge the world. And He would also that this sacrement should be received as the 
spiritual food of souls, whereby may be fed and strengthened those who live with His life 
who said, He that eateth me, the same also shall live by me; and as an antidote, whereby 
we may be freed from daily faults, and be preserved from mortal sins. He would, 
furthermore, have it be a pledge of our glory to come, and everlasting happiness, and thus 
be a symbol of that one body whereof He is the head, and to which He would fain have us 
as members be united by the closest bond of faith, hope, and charity, that we might all 
speak the same things, and there might be no schisms amongst us. 
CHAPTER III.  
On the excellency of the most holy Eucharist over the rest of the Sacraments. 
The most holy Eucharist has indeed this in common with the rest of the sacraments, that it 
is a symbol of a sacred thing, and is a visible form of an invisible grace; but there is found 
in the Eucharist this excellent and peculiar thing, that the other sacraments have then first 
the power of sanctifying when one uses them, whereas in the Eucharist, before being 
used, there is the [Page 78] Author Himself of sanctity. For the apostles had not as yet 
received the Eucharist from the hand of the Lord, when nevertheless Himself affirmed 
with truth that to be His own body which He presented (to them). And this faith has ever 
been in the Church of God, that, immediately after the consecration, the veritable Body of 
our Lord, and His veritable Blood, together with His soul and divinity, are under the 
species of bread and wine; but the Body indeed under the species of bread, and the Blood 
under the species of wine, by the force of the words; but the body itself under the species 
of wine, and the blood under the species of bread, and the soul under both, by the force of 
that natural connexion and concomitancy whereby the parts of Christ our Lord, who hath 
now risen from the dead, to die no more, are united together; and the divinity, 
furthermore, on account of the admirable hypostatical union thereof with His body and 
soul. Wherefore it is most true, that as much is contained under either species as under 
both; for Christ whole and entire is under the species of bread, and under any part 
whatsoever of that species; likewise the whole (Christ) is under the species of wine, and 
under the parts thereof. 
CHAPTER IV.  
On Transubstantiation. 
And because that Christ, our Redeemer, declared that which He offered under the species 
of bread to be truly His own body, therefore has it ever been a firm belief in the Church of 
God, and this holy Synod doth now declare it anew, that, by the consecration of the bread 
and of the wine, a conversion is made of the whole substance of the bread into the 
substance of the body of Christ our Lord, and of the whole substance of the wine into the 
substance of His blood; which conversion is, by the holy Catholic Church, suitably and 
properly called Transubstantiation. 
[Page 79] 
CHAPTER V.  
On the cult and veneration to be shown to this most holy Sacrament. 
Wherefore, there is no room left for doubt, that all the faithful of Christ may, according to 
the custom ever received in the Catholic Church, render in veneration the worship of 
latria, which is due to the true God, to this most holy sacrament. For not therefore is it the 
less to be adored on this account, that it was instituted by Christ, the Lord, in order to be 
received: for we believe that same God to be present therein, of whom the eternal Father, 
when introducing him into the world, says; And let all the angels of God adore him; 
whom the Magi falling down, adored; who, in fine, as the Scripture testifies, was adored 
by the apostles in Galilee. 
The holy Synod declares, moreover, that very piously and religiously was this custom 
introduced into the Church, that this sublime and venerable sacrament be, with special 
veneration and solemnity, celebrated, every year, on a certain day, and that a festival; and 
that it be borne reverently and with honour in processions through the streets, and public 
places. For it is most just that there be certain appointed holy days, whereon all Christians 
may, with a special and unusual demonstration, testify that their minds are grateful and 
thankful to their common Lord and Redeemer for so ineffable and truly divine a benefit, 
whereby the victory and triumph of His death are represented. And so indeed did it 
behove victorious truth to celebrate a triumph over falsehood and heresy, that thus her 
adversaries, at the sight of so much splendour, and in the midst of so great joy of the 
universal Church, may either pine away weakened and broken; or, touched with shame 
and confounded, at length repent. 
[Page 80] 
CHAPTER VI.  
On reserving the Sacrament of the sacred Eucharist, and bearing it to the Sick.
 The custom of reserving the holy Eucharist in the sacrarium is so ancient, that even the 
age of the Council of Nicaea recognised that usage. Moreover, as to carrying the sacred 
Eucharist itself to the sick, and carefully reserving it for this purpose in churches, besides 
that it is exceedingly conformable to equity and reason, it is also found enjoined in 
numerous councils, and is a very ancient observance of the Catholic Church. Wherefore, 
this holy Synod ordains, that this salutary and necessary custom is to be by all means 
retained. 
CHAPTER VII.  
On the preparation to be given that one may worthily receive the sacred Eucharist. 
If it is unbeseeming for any one to approach to any of the sacred functions, unless he 
approach holily; assuredly, the more the holiness and divinity of this heavenly sacrament 
are understood by a Christian, the more diligently ought he to give heed that he approach 
not to receive it but with great reverence and holiness, especially as we read in the 
Apostle those words full of terror; He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and 
drinketh judgment to himself. Wherefore, he who would communicate, ought to recall to 
mind the precept of the Apostle; Let a man prove himself. Now ecclesiastical usage 
declares that necessary proof to be, that no one, conscious to himself [Page 81] of mortal 
sin, how contrite soever he may seem to himself, ought to approach to the sacred 
Eucharist without previous sacramental confession. This the holy Synod hath decreed is 
to be invariably observed by all Christians, even by those priests on whom it may be 
incumbent by their office to celebrate, provided the opportunity of a confessor do not fail 
them; but if, in an urgent necessity, a priest should celebrate without previous confession, 
let him confess as soon as possible. 
CHAPTER VIII.  
On the use of this admirable Sacrament. 
Now as to the use of this holy sacrament, our Fathers have rightly and wisely 
distinguished three ways of receiving it. For they have taught that some receive it 
sacramentally only, to wit sinners: others spiritually only, those to wit who eating in 
desire that heavenly bread which is set before them, are, by a lively faith which worketh 
by charity, made sensible of the fruit and usefulness thereof: whereas the third (class) 
receive it both sacramentally and spiritually, and these are they who so prove and prepare 
themselves beforehand, as to approach to this divine table clothed with the wedding 
garment. Now as to the reception of the sacrament, it was always the custom in the 
Church of God, that laymen should receive the communion from priests; but that priests 
when celebrating should communicate themselves; which custom, as coming down from 
an apostolical tradition, ought with justice and reason to be retained. And finally this holy 
Synod with true fatherly affection admonishes, exhorts, begs, and beseeches, through the 
bowels of the mercy of our God, that all and each of those who bear the Christian name 
would now at length agree and be of one mind in this sign of unity, in this bond of 
charity, in this symbol of concord; and that mindful of the so great majesty, and the so 
[Page 82] exceeding love of our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave His own beloved soul as the 
price of our salvation, and gave us His own flesh to eat, they would believe and venerate 
these sacred mysteries of His body and blood with such constancy and firmness of faith, 
with such devotion of soul, with such piety and worship as to be able frequently to receive 
that supersubstantial bread, and that it may be to them truly the life of the soul, and the 
perpetual health of their mind; that being invigorated by the strength thereof, they may, 
after the journeying of this miserable pilgrimage, be able to arrive at their heavenly 
country, there to eat, without any veil, that same bread of angels which they now eat 
under the sacred veils. 
But forasmuch as it is not enough to declare the truth, if errors be not laid bare and 
repudiated, it hath seemed good to the holy Synod to subjoin these canons, that all, -the 
Catholic doctrine being already recognised,-may now also understand what are the 
heresies which they ought to guard against and avoid. 
ON THE MOST HOLY SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST
 CANON I.-If any one denieth, that, in the sacrament of the most holy Eucharist, are 
contained truly, really, and substantially, the body and blood together with the soul and 
divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ, and consequently the whole Christ; but saith that He is 
only therein as in a sign, or in figure, or virtue; let him be anathema. 
CANON lI.-If any one saith, that, in the sacred and holy sacrament of the Eucharist, the 
substance of the bread and wine remains conjointly with the body and blood of our Lord 
Jesus Christ, and denieth that wonderful and singular conversion of the whole substance 
of the bread into the Body, and of the whole substance of the wine into the Blood-the 
species Only of the bread and wine remaining-which conversion indeed the Catholic 
Church most aptly calls Transubstantiation; let him be anathema. 
CANON III.-If any one denieth, that, in the venerable sacrament of the Eucharist, the 
whole Christ is contained under each [Page 83] species, and under every part of each 
species, when separated; let him be anathema. 
CANON IV.-If any one saith, that, after the consecration is completed, the body and 
blood of our Lord Jesus Christ are not in the admirable sacrament of the Eucharist, but 
(are there) only during the use, whilst it is being taken, and not either before or after; and 
that, in the hosts, or consecrated particles, which are reserved or which remain after 
communion, the true Body of the Lord remaineth not; let him be anathema. 
CANON V.-If any one saith, either that the principal fruit of the most holy Eucharist is 
the remission of sins, or, that other effects do not result therefrom; let him be anathema. 
CANON VI.-If any one saith, that, in the holy sacrament of the Eucharist, Christ, the only
begotten Son of God, is not to be adored with the worship, even external of latria; and is, 
consequently, neither to be venerated with a special festive solemnity, nor to be solemnly 
borne about in processions, according to the laudable and universal rite and custom of 
holy church; or, is not to be proposed publicly to the people to be adored, and that the 
adorers thereof are idolators; let him be anathema. 
CANON VII.-If any one saith, that it is not lawful for the sacred Eucharist to be reserved 
in the sacrarium, but that, immediately after consecration, it must necessarily be 
distributed amongst those present; or, that it is not lawful that it be carried with honour to 
the sick; let him be anathema. 
CANON VIII.-lf any one saith, that Christ, given in the Eucharist, is eaten spiritually 
only, and not also sacramentally and really; let him be anathema. 
CANON IX.-If any one denieth, that all and each of Christ's faithful of both sexes are 
bound, when they have attained to years of discretion, to communicate every year, at least 
at Easter, in accordance with the precept of holy Mother Church; let him be anathema. 
[Page 84] CANON X.-If any one saith, that it is not lawful for the celebrating priest to 
communicate himself; let him be anathema. 
CANON XI.-lf any one saith, that faith alone is a sufficient preparation for receiving the 
sacrament of the most holy Eucharist; let him be anathema. And for fear lest so great a 
sacrament may be received unworthily, and so unto death and condemnation, this holy 
Synod ordains and declares, that sacramental confession, when a confessor may be had, is 
of necessity to be made beforehand, by those whose conscience is burthened with mortal 
sin, how contrite even soever they may think themselves. But if any one shall presume to 
teach, preach, or obstinately to assert, or even in public disputation to defend the contrary, 
he shall be thereupon excommunicated. 
DECREE ON REFORMATION 
CHAPTER I.  
Bishops shall apply themselves with prudence to reform the manners of their subjects: 
from the correction of those bishops there shall be appeal. 
The same sacred and holy Synod,-lawfully assembled in the Holy Ghost, the same legate 
and nuncios of the Apostolic See presiding therein,-purposing to ordain certain things 
which relate to the jurisdiction of bishops, in order that they may, in accordance with the 
decree of the last Session, so much the more willingly reside in the churches committed to 
them, by how much they shall be able, with greater ease and convenience, to rule and to 
keep in propriety of life and conversation those subject to them, thinks it meet that the 
bishops be first of all admonished to bear in mind, that they are pastors and not strikers, 
and that they ought so to preside over those subject to them, as not to lord it over them, 
but to love them as sons and brethren; and to strive, by exhortation and admonition, [Page 
85] to deter them from what is unlawful, that they may not be obliged, should they 
transgress, to coerce them by due punishments. Towards whom, however, should they 
happen to sin in any manner through human frailty, that injunction of the apostle is by 
bishops to be observed, that they reprove, entreat, rebuke them in all kindness and 
doctrine; seeing that benevolence towards those to be corrected often effects more than 
austerity; exhortation more than menace; charity more than power. But if, on account of 
the grievousness of the transgression, there be need of the rod, then is rigour to be 
tempered with gentleness, judgment with mercy, severity with lenit; that so discipline, so 
salutary and necessary for the people, may be preserved without harshness; and they who 
are chastened may be amended, or, if they will not repent, that others, by the wholesome 
example of their punishment, may be deterred from vices; since it is the office of a pastor, 
at once vigilant and kind, to apply first of all gentle fomentations to the disorders of his 
sheep, and afterwards to proceed to sharper and more violent remedies, when the 
grievousness of the distempers may require them; but if not even these are effectual in 
removing those disorders, then is he to free the other sheep at least from the danger of 
contagion. Whereas, therefore, those guilty of crimes, ordinarily, in order to avoid 
punishment, and to evade the judgments of their bishops, affect to have subjects of 
complaint and grievances, and, under the subterfuge of an appeal, impede the process of 
the judge, (this Synod) in order to prevent a remedy which was instituted for the 
protection of innocence, from being abused to the defence of wickedness, and that this 
their craft and tergiversation may be met, hath ordained and decreed that: In causes 
relative to visitation and correction, or to competency or incompetency, as also in 
criminal causes, there shall be no appeal, before the definitive sentence, from the bishop 
or his vicar general in spirituals, against any interlocutory sentence, or other (alleged) 
grievance, whatsoever; neither shall the bishop, nor his vicar, be bound to defer to any 
[Page 86] such appeal, as being frivolous; but they may proceed to ulterior measures, that 
appeal, or any inhibition whatsoever emanating from a judge of appeal, as also every 
usage and custom even immemorial, to the contrary notwithstanding; except it be that the 
said grievance cannot be repaired by the definitive sentence, or that there is no appeal 
from the said definitive sentence; in which cases the statutes of the ancient canons shall 
remain untouched. 
CHAPTER II.  
An appeal from the bishop in criminal causes, when to be committed to the Metropolitan, 
or to one of the nearest bishops. 
A case of appeal-where there is room for such appeal-from the sentence of the bishop, or 
that of his vicar general, shall, if it happen to be a case committed by apostolic authority 
to judges on the spot, be referred to the metropolitan, or even to his vicar general in 
spirituals; or if that metropolitan be for some cause suspected, or be distant more than two 
days' journey as settled by law, or if it be from him that the appeal is made, the case shall 
be committed to one of the nearest bishops, or to the vicars thereof, but not to inferior 
judges. 
CHAPTER III.  
The acts of the first instance shall, within thirty days, be given gratuitously to the accused 
appellant. 
The accused who is in a criminal cause an appellant from the bishop, or from his vicar 
general in spirituals, shall absolutely produce, before the judge to whom he has appealed, 
the acts of the first instance; and the judge shall by no means proceed, without having 
seen them, to the absolution of the accused. And he, from whom the appeal is made, shall 
furnish on the demand (of the appellant), the said acts gratuitously within thirty days; 
otherwise the said case of appeal shall be terminated without them, in the way that justice 
may require. 
[Page 87] 
CHAPTER IV.  
In what manner clerics are, on account of grievous crimes, to be degraded from sacred 
Orders. 
And whereas crimes so grievous are sometimes committed by ecclesiastics, that, on 
account of the atrocity thereof, they have to be deposed from sacred orders, and delivered 
over to a secular court; in which case a certain number of bishops is, according to the 
Canons, required; and whereas, should there be a difficulty in assembling them all, the 
due execution of the law would be retarded; whilst, should they on any occasion be able 
to be present, their residence would be interrupted; therefore hath the Synod resolved and 
decreed, that it shall be lawful for a bishop, by himself or by his vicar general in 
spirituals, without the presence even of other bishops, to proceed against a cleric, even 
against one who is raised to the sacred order of the priesthood, even to his condemnation, 
as also to his verbal deposition; and he shall be able by himself to proceed even to actual 
and solemn degradation from the said ecclesiastical orders and degrees, in the cases 
wherein the presence of other bishops, in a specific number, is required by the Canons; 
taking, however, to himself, and being assisted therein by, a like number of abbots, who 
have the right of using the mitre and crosier by apostolic privilege, if so be that they can 
be found in the city, or diocese, and can conveniently be present; or in their default, 
(being assisted) by (a like number of) others persons constituted in ecclesiastical dignity, 
who are of weight by their age and recommended by their knowledge of law. 
CHAPTER V.  
The bishop shall take summary cognizance of graces whereby a sin, or a punishment, is 
remitted. 
And because it sometimes happens that, under false pleas, which notwithstanding seem 
probable enough, certain persons [Page 88] fraudulently obtain graces, whereby the 
punishments inflicted on them by the just severity of their bishops are either wholly 
remitted, or are mitigated; and whereas it is a thing not to be borne, that a lie, which is so 
exceedingly displeasing to God, should not only itself go unpunished, but even obtain for 
him that tells it, the pardon of another crime; the Synod hath for this cause ordained and 
decreed as follows: That a bishop, resident in his own church, shall of himself, as the 
delegate of the Apostolic See, take cognizance even summarily of the surreption or 
obreption of any grace, obtained under false pretences, for the absolution of any public 
crime or delinquency, into which he himself had instituted an inquiry; or for the remission 
of a punishment to which he has himself condemned the criminal; and he shall not admit 
the said grace, after that it shall have been lawfully ascertained, that it was obtained by the 
statement of what is false, or by the suppression of the truth. 
CHAPTER VI.  
A bishop shall not be personally cited, save in a case involving deposition, or deprivation.
 And whereas the subjects of a bishop, even though they have been justly chastened, do 
often nevertheless bear him a violent hatred, and, as if they had suffered some wrong at 
his hands, object false accusations against him, in order that they may annoy him by 
whatsoever means lie in their power,-the fear which annoyance doth for the most part 
render the bishop more backward in inquiring into and punishing delinquencies; therefore, 
that a bishop may not be compelled-both to his own great inconvenience and that of his 
Church-to abandon the flock entrusted to him, and that he may not be forced-not without 
the diminution of the episcopal dignity-to wander from place to place, (the Synod) hath 
thus ordained and decreed: That a [Page 89] bishop, even though he be proceeded against 
ex officio, or by way of inquiry, or denunciation, or accusation, or in any other way 
whatsoever, shall not be cited or warned to appear in person, except for a cause for which 
he might have to be deposed from, or deprived of, his office. 
CHAPTER VII.  
The qualifications of witnesses against a bishop are described. 
In a criminal cause, witnesses shall not be received against a bishop, whether as to the 
information, or proofs, or other process affecting the principal point of the case, unless 
their testimony agree, and they be of a good life, in good esteem and reputation; and if 
they shall have made any deposition through hatred, rashness, or interest, they shall be 
subjected to grievous punishments. 
CHAPTER VIII.  
Important episcopal causes shall be taken cognizance of by the Supreme Pontiff.
The causes of bishops, when, on account of the quality of the crime objected, they have to 
appear (in person), shall be carried before the Sovereign Pontiff, and be by him decided. 
DECREE FOR POSTPONING THE DEFINITION OF FOUR ARTICLES TOUCHING 
THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST, AND FOR GIVING A SAFE-CONDUCT 
TO PROTESTANTS 
The same holy Synod,-desiring to pluck out of the field of the Lord all the errors which 
like thorns have sprung up again on the subject of this most holy sacrament, and wishing 
to provide for the salvation of all the faithful, her daily prayers being devoutly offered up 
to Almighty God for this end,-amongst the other articles, relative to this sacrament, which 
have been treated of with the most diligent inquiry into Catholic truth; very many and 
most accurate conferences, according to [Page 89] the importance of the matters, having 
been held, and the sentiments also of the most eminent theologians having been 
ascertained; has likewise treated of these following: whether it be necessary to salvation, 
and be prescribed of divine right, that all the faithful of Christ receive the said venerable 
sacrament under both species. And; whether he who communicates under either species 
receive less than he who communicates under both. And; whether holy Mother Church 
hath erred, by communicating, under the species of bread only, the laity, and priests when 
not celebrating. And; whether little children also are to be communicated. But whereas 
those, of the most noble province of Germany, who call themselves Protestants, desire to 
be heard by the holy Synod upon these said articles before they are defined, and for this 
end have asked for the public faith from the Synod, that they may be allowed to come 
hither in safety, dwell in this city, speak freely and set forth their sentiments before the 
Synod, and afterwards depart when they please; this holy Synod,-although It has looked 
forward with great earnestness for many months past for their coming, nevertheless, as an 
affectionate mother that groaneth and travaileth, most ardently desiring and labouring 
after this, that, amongst those who bear the Christian name, there may be no schisms, but 
that, even as all acknowledge the same God and Redeemer, so may all say the same thing, 
believe the same, think the same,-trusting in the mercy of God, and hoping that the result 
will be that they may be brought back to the most holy and salutary concord of one faith, 
hope, and charity, (and) yielding to them herein, hath, as far as the said Synod is 
concerned, given and granted, according to their request; a public assurance and faith, 
which they call a safe-conduct, of the tenor which will be set down below; and for their 
sakes It hath postponed the definition of those articles to the second next Session, which, 
that they may conveniently be present thereat, It hath indicted for the festival of the 
conversion of Saint Paul, which will be on the twenty-fifth day of the month of January of 
the ensuing year. And It furthermore ordains, that the [Page 91] sacrifice of the mass, on 
account of the close connexion between the two subjects, shall be treated of in the same 
Session; and that meanwhile It will treat of the sacraments of Penance and Extreme 
Unction in the next Session, which It hath decreed is to be held on the festival of Saint 
Catharine, virgin and martyr, which will be the twenty-fifth of November; and that at the 
same time, in both Sessions, the matter of reformation shall be proceeded with. 
SAFE-CONDUCT GRANTED TO PROTESTANTS
The sacred and holy, general Synod of Trent,-lawfully assembled in the Holy Ghost, the 
same Legate and Nuncios of the holy Apostolic See presiding therein,-grants, as far as 
regards the holy Synod itself, to all and each one throughout the whole of Germany, 
whether ecclesiastics or Seculars, of whatsoever degree, estate, condition, quality they be, 
who may wish to repair to this oecumenical and general Council, the public faith and full 
security, which they call a safe-conduct, with all and each of the necessary and suitable 
clauses and decrees, even though they ought to be expressed specifically and not in 
general terms, and which it is Its wish shall be considered as expressed, so as that they 
may and shall have it in their power in all liberty to confer, make proposals, and treat on 
those things which are to be treated of in the said Synod; to come freely and safely to the 
said oecumenical Council, and there remain and abide, and propose therein, as well in 
writing as by word of mouth, as many articles as to them shall seem good, and to confer 
and dispute, without any abuse or contumely, with the Fathers, or with those who may 
have been selected by the said holy Synod; as also to withdraw whensoever they shall 
think fit. It hath furthermore seemed good to the holy Synod, that if, for their greater 
liberty and security, they desire that certain judges be deputed on their behalf, in regard of 
crimes whether committed, or that may be committed, by them, they shall themselves 
nominate those who are favourable towards them, even though the said crimes should be 
ever so enormous and should savour of heresy.

SESSION THE FOURTEENTH,
 Being the fourth under the Sovereign Pontiff, Julius III., celebrated on the twenty-fifth of 
November, MDLI. 
ON THE MOST HOLY SACRAMENTS OF PENANCE AND EXTREME UNCTION 
Doctrine on the Sacrament of Penance. 
The sacred and holy, oecumenical and general Synod of Trent, -lawfully assembled in the 
Holy Ghost, the same Legate and Nuncios of the holy Apostolic See presiding therein, -
although, in the decree concerning Justification, there has been, through a certain kind of 
necessity, on account of the affinity of the subjects, much discourse introduced touching 
the sacrament of Penance; nevertheless, so great, in these our days, is the multitude of 
various errors relative to this sacrament, that it will be of no small public utility to have 
given thereof a more exact and full definition, wherein, all errors having been, under the 
protection of the Holy Ghost, pointed out and extirpated, Catholic truth may be made 
clear and resplendent; which (Catholic truth) this holy Synod now sets before all 
Christians to be perpetually retained. 
CHAPTER I.  
On the necessity, and on the institution of the Sacrament of Penance.
 If such, in all the regenerate, were their gratitude towards God, as that they constantly 
preserved the justice received in baptism by His bounty and grace; there would not have 
been need for another sacrament, besides that of baptism itself, to be instituted for the 
remission of sins But because God, rich in mercy, knows our frame, He hath bestowed a 
remedy of life even on [Page 93] those who may, after baptism, have delivered 
themselves up to the servitude of sin and the power of the devil, --the sacrament to wit of 
Penance, by which the benefit of the death of Christ is applied to those who have fallen 
after baptism. Penitence was in deed at all times neccessary, in order to attain to grace and 
justice, for all men who had defiled themselves by any mortal sin, even for those who 
begged to be washed by the sacrament of Baptism ; that so, their perverseness renounced 
and amended, they might, with a hatred of sin and a godly sorrow of mind, detest so great 
an offence of God. Wherefore the prophet says; Be converted and do penance for all your 
iniquities, and iniquity shall not be your ruin. The Lord also said; Except you do penance, 
you shall also likewise perish; and Peter, the prince of the apostoles, reconmending 
penitence to sinners who were about to be initiated by baptism, said; Do penance, and be 
baptized every one you. Nevertheless, neither before the coming of Christ was penitance a 
sacrament, nor is it such, since His coming, to any previously to baptism. But the Lord 
then principally instituted the sacrament of penance, when, being raised from the dead, He 
breathed upon His disciples, saying Receive ye the Holy Ghost, whose sins you shall 
forgive, they are forgiven them, and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained. By 
which action so signal, and words so clear, the consent of all the Fathers has ever 
understood, that the power of forgiving and retaining sins was communicated to the 
apostles and their lawful successors, for the reconciling of the faithful who have fallen 
after baptism. And the Catholic Church with great reason repudiated and condemned as 
heretics, the Novatians, who of old obstinately denied that power of forgiving. Wherefore, 
this holy Synod, approving of and re ceiving as most true this meaning of those words of 
our Lord, condemns the fanciful interpretations of those who, in opposition to the 
institution of this sacrament, falsely wrest those words to the power of preaching the word 
of God, and of an nouncing the Gospel of Christ. 
[Page 93] 
CHAPTER II.  
On the difference between the Sacrament of Penance and that of Baptism
 For the rest, this sacrament is clearly seen to be different from baptism in many respects: 
for besides that it is very widely different indeed in matter and form, which constitute the 
essence of a sacrament, it is beyond doubt certain that the minister of baptism need not be 
a judge, seeing that the Church exercises judgment on no one who has not entered therein 
through the gate of baptism. For, what have I, saith the apostle, to do to judge them that 
are without? It is otherwise with those who are of the household of the faith, whom Christ 
our Lord has once, by the laver of baptism, made the members of His own body; for such, 
if they should afterwards have defiled themselves by any crime, He would no longer have 
them cleansed by a repetition of baptism--that being nowise lawful in the Catholic Church
but be placed as criminals before this tribunal; that, by the sentence of the priests, they 
might be freed, not once, but as often as, being penitent, they should, from their sins 
committed, flee thereunto. Furthermore, one is the fruit of baptism, and another that of 
penance. For, by baptism putting on Christ, we are made therein entirely a new creature, 
obtaining a full and entire remission of all sins: unto which newness and entireness, 
however, we are no ways able to arrive by the sacrament of Penance, without many tears 
and great labours on our parts, the divine justice demanding this; so that penance has 
justly been called by holy Fathers a laborious kind of baptism. And this sacrament of 
Penance is, for those who have fallen after baptism, necessary unto salvation; as baptism 
itself is for those who have not as yet been regenerated. 
[Page 92] 
CHAPTER III.  
On the parts, and on the fruit of this Sacrament. 
The holy synod doth furthermore teach, that the form of the sacrament of penance, 
wherein its force principally consists, is placed in those words of the minister, I absolve 
thee, &c: to which words indeed certain prayers are, according to the custom of holy 
Church, laudably joined, which nevertheless by no means regard the essence of that form, 
neither are they neces sary for the administration of the sacrament itself. But the acts of 
the penitent himself, to wit, contrition, confession and satisfaction, are as it were the 
matter of this sacrament. Which acts, inasmuch as they are, by God's institution, required 
in the penitent for the integrity of the sacrament, and for the full and perfect remission of 
sins, are for this reason called the parts of penance. But the thing signified indeed and the 
effect of this sacrament, as far as regards its force and efficacy, is reconciliation with God, 
which sometimes, in persons who are pious and who receive this sacrament with 
devotion, is wont to be followed by peace and serenity of conscience, with exceed ing 
consolation of spirit. The holy Synod, whilst delivering these things touching the parts 
and the effect of this sacrament, condemns at the same time the opinions of those who 
contend, that, the terrors which agitate the conscience, and faith, are the parts of penance. 
CHAPTER IV.  
On Contrition. 
Contrition, which holds the first place amongst the aforesaid acts of the penitent, is a 
sorrow of mind, and a detestation for sin committed, with the purpose of not sinning for 
the future. [Page 96] This movement of contrition was at all times necessary for obtaining 
the pardon of sins; and, in one who has fallen after baptism, it then at length prepares for 
the remissions of sins, when it is united with confidence in the divine mercy, and with the 
desire of performing the other things which are required for rightly receiving this 
sacrament. Wherefore the holy Synod declares, that this contrition contains not only a 
cessation from sin, and the purpose and the beginning of a new life, but also a hatred of 
the old, agreeably to that saying; Cast away from you all your iniquities, wherein you 
have transgressed, and make to yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. And assuredly he 
who has considered those cries of the saints; To thee only have I sinned, and have done 
evil before thee, I have laboured in my groaning, every night I will wash my bed, I will 
recount to thee all my years, in the bitterness of my soul, and others of this kind, will 
easily understand that they flowed from a certain vehement hatred of their past life, and 
from an exceeding detestation of sins. The Synod teaches moreover, that, although it 
sometimes happen that this contrition is perfect through charity, and reconciles man with 
God before this sacrament be actually received, the said reconciliation, nevertheless, is 
not to be ascribed to that contrition, independently of the desire of the sacrament which is 
included therein. And as to that imperfect contrition, which is called attrition, because that 
it is commonly conceived either from the consideration of the turpitude of sin, or from the 
fear of hell and of punishment, It declares that if, with the hope of pardon, it exclude the 
wish to sin, it not only does not make a man a hypocrite, and a greater sinner, but that it is 
even a gift of God, and an impulse of the Holy Ghost, --who does not indeed as yet dwell 
in the penitent, but only moves him, --whereby the penitent being assisted prepares a way 
for himself unto justice. And although this (attrition) cannot of itself, without the 
sacrament of penance, conduct the sinner to justification, yet does it dispose him to obtain 
the grace of God in the sacrament of [Page 97] Penance. For, smitten profitably with this 
fear, the Ninivites, at the preaching of Jonas, did fearful penance and obtained mercy 
from the Lord. Wherefore falsely do some calumniate Catholic writers, as if they had 
maintained that the sacrament of Penance confers grace without any good motion on the 
part of those who receive it: a thing which the Church of God never taught, or thought: 
and falsely also do they assert that contrition is extorted and forced, not free and 
voluntary. 
CHAPTER V.  
On Confession. 
From the institution of the sacrament of Penance as already explained, the universal 
Church has always understood, that the entire confession of sins was also instituted by the 
Lord, and is of divine right necessary for all who have fallen after baptism; because that 
our Lord Jesus Christ, when about to ascend from earth to heaven, left priests His own 
vicars, as presidents and judges, unto whom all the mortal crimes, into which the faithful 
of Christ may have fallen, should be carried, in order that, in accordance with the power 
of the keys, they may pronounce the sentence of forgiveness or retention of sins. For it is 
manifest, that priests could not have exercised this judgment without knowledge of the 
cause; neither indeed could they have observed equity in enjoining punishments, if the 
said faithful should have declared their sins in general only, and not rather specifically, 
and one by one. Whence it is gathered that all the mortal sins, of which, after a diligent 
examination of themselves, they are conscious, must needs be by penitents enumerated in 
confession, even though those sins be most [Page 98] hidden, and committed only against 
the two last precepts of the decalogue,--sins which sometimes wound the soul more 
grievously, and are more dangerous, than those which are committed outwardly. For 
venial sins, whereby we are not excluded from the grace of God, and into which we fall 
more frequently, although they be rightly and profitably, and without any presumption 
declared in confession, as the custom of pious persons demonstrates, yet may they be 
omitted without guilt, and be expiated by many other remedies. But, whereas all mortal 
sins, even those of thought, render men children of wrath, and enemies of God, it is 
necessary to seek also for the pardon of them all from God, with an open and modest 
confession. Wherefore, while the faithful of Christ are careful to confess all the sins 
which occur to their memory, they without doubt lay them all bare before the mercy of 
God to be pardoned: whereas they who act otherwise, and knowingly keep back certain 
sins, such set nothing before the divine bounty to be forgiven through the priest: for if the 
sick be ashamed to show his wound to the physician, his medical art cures not that which 
it knows not of. We gather furthermore, that those circumstances which change the 
species of the sin are also to be explained in confession, because that, without them, the 
sins themselves are neither entirely set forth by the penitents, nor are they known clearly 
to the judges; and it cannot be that they can estimate rightly the grievousness of the 
crimes, and impose on the penitents, the punishment which ought to be inflicted, on 
account of them. Whence it is unreasonable to teach, that these circumstances have been 
invented by idle men; or, that one circumstance only is to be confessed, to wit, that one 
has sinned against a brother. But it is also impious to assert, that confession, enjoined to 
be made in this manner, is impossible, or to call it a slaughter-house of consciences: for it 
is certain, that in the Church nothing else is required of penitents, but that, after each has 
examined himself diligently, and searched all the folds and recesses of his conscience, he 
confess those sins by which he shall remember that he has mortally offended [Page 99] 
his Lord and God: whilst the other sins, which do not occur to him after diligent thought, 
are understood to be included as a whole in that same confession; for which sins we 
confidently say with the prophet; From my secret sins cleanse me, O Lord. Now, the very 
difficulty of a confession like this, and the shame of making known one's sins, might 
indeed seem a grievous thing, were it not alleviated by the so many and so great 
advantages and consolations, which are most assuredly bestowed by absolution upon all 
who worthily approach to this sacrament. For the rest, as to the manner of confessing 
secretly to a priest alone, although Christ has not forbidden that a person may,--in 
punishment of his sins, and for his own humi liation, as well for an example to others as 
for the edification of the Church that has been scandalized,--confess his sins publicly, 
nevertheless this is not commanded by a divine precept; neither would it very prudent to 
enjoin by any human law, that sins, especially such as are secret, should be made known 
by a public confession. Wherefore, whereas the secret sacramental confession, which was 
in use from the beginning in holy Church, and is still also in use, has always been 
commended by the most holy and the most ancient Fathers with a great and unanimous 
consent, the vain calumny of those is manifestly refuted, who are not ashamed to teach, 
that confession is alien from the divine command, and is a human invention, and that it 
took its rise from the Fathers assembled in the Council of Lateran: for the Church did not, 
through the Council of Lateran, ordain that the faithful of Christ should confess,--a thing 
which it knew to be necessary, and to be instituted of divine right,--but that the precept of 
confession should be complied with, at least once a year, by all and each, when they have 
attained to years of discretion. Whence, throughout the whole Church, the salutary custom 
is, to the great benefit of the souls of the faithful, now observed, of confessing at that most 
sacred and most acceptable time of Lent,--a custom which this holy Synod most highly 
approves of and embraces, as pious and worthy of being retained. 
[Page 100] 
CHAPTER VI.  
On the ministry of this Sacrament, and on Absolution.
 But, as regards the minister of this sacrament, the holy Synod declares all these doctrines 
to be false, and utterly alien from the truth of the Gospel, which perniciously extend the 
ministry of the keys to any others soever besides bishops and priests; imagining, contrary 
to the institution of this sacrament, that those words of our Lord, Whatsoever you shall 
bind upon earth, shall be bound also in heaven, and whatsoever you shall loose upon earth 
shall be loosed also in heaven, and, Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them, 
and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained,were in such wise addressed to all the 
faithful of Christ indifferently and indiscriminately, as that every one has the power of 
forgiving sins,-public sins to wit by rebuke, provided he that is rebuked shall acquiesce, 
and secret sins by a voluntary confession made to any individual whatsoever. It also 
teaches, that even priests, who are in mortal sin, exercise, through the virtue of the Holy 
Ghost which was bestowed in ordination, the office of forgiving sins, as the ministers of 
Christ; and that their sentiment is erroneous who contend that this power exists not in bad 
priests. But although the absolution of the priest is the dispensation of another's bounty, 
yet is it not a bare ministry only, whether of announcing the Gospel, or of declaring that 
sins are forgiven, but is after the manner of a judicial act, whereby sentence is pronounced 
by the priest as by a judge: and therefore the penitent ought not so to confide in his own 
personal faith, as to think that,--even though there be no contrition on his part, or no 
intention on the part of the priest of acting seriously and absolving truly,--he is 
nevertheless truly and in God's sight absolved, on account of his faith alone. For neither 
would [Page 101] faith without penance bestow any remission of sins; nor would he be 
otherwise than most careless of his own salvation, who, knowing that a priest but 
absolved him in jest, should not care fully seek for another who would act in earnest. 
CHAPTER VII.  
On the Reservation of Cases. 
Wherefore, since the nature and order of a judgment require this, that sentence be passed 
only on those subject (to that judicature), it has ever been firmly held in the Church of 
God, and this Synod ratifies it as a thing most true, that the absolution, which a priest 
pronounces upon one over whom he has not either an ordinary or a deligated jurisdiction, 
ought to be of no weight whatever. And it hath seemed to our most holy Fathers to be of 
great importance to the discipline of the Christian people, that certain more atrocious and 
more heinous crimes should be absolved, not by all priests, but only by the highest 
priests: whence the Sovereign Pontiffs, in virtue of the supreme power delivered to them 
in the universal Church, were deservedly able to reserve, for their special judgment, 
certain more grievous cases of crimes. Neither is it to be doubted,--seeing that all things, 
that are from God, are well ordered-but that this same may be lawfully done by all 
bishops, each in his own diocese, unto edification, however, not unto destruction, in virtue 
of the authority, above (that of) other inferior priests, delivered to them over their 
subjects, especially as regards those crimes to which the censure of excommunication is 
annexed. But it is consonant to the divine authority, that this reservation of cases have 
effect, not merely in external polity, but also in God's sight. Nevertheless, for fear lest any 
may perish on this account, it has always been very piously observed in the said Church 
of God, that there be no reservation at the point [Page 102] of death, and that therefore all 
priests may absolve all penitents whatsoever from every kind of sins and censures 
whatever: and as, save at that point of death, priests have no power in reserved cases, let 
this alone be their endeavour, to persuade penitents to repair to superior and lawful judges 
for the benefit of absolution. 
CHAPTER VIII.  
On the necessity and on the fruit of Satisfaction. 
Finally, as regards satisfaction,--which as it is, of all the parts of penance, that which has 
been at all times recommended to the Christian people by our Fathers, so is it the one 
especially which in our age is, under the loftiest pretext of piety, impugned by those who 
have an appearance of godliness, but have denied the power thereof,--the holy Synod 
declares, that it is wholly false, and alien from the word of God, that the guilt is never 
forgiven by the Lord, without the whole punishment also being therewith pardoned. For 
clear and illustrious examples are found in the sacred writings, whereby, besides by 
divine tradition, this error is refuted in the plainest manner possible. And truly the nature 
of divine justice seems to demand, that they, who through ignorance have sinned before 
baptism, be received into grace in one manner; and in another those who, after having 
been freed from the servitude of sin and of the devil, and after having received the gift of 
the Holy Ghost, have not feared, knowingly to violate the temple of God, and to grieve 
the Holy Spirit. And it beseems the divine clemency, that sins be not in such wise 
pardoned us without any sat is fac tion, as that, taking occasion therefrom, thinking sins 
less grievous, we, offering as it were an insult and an outrage to the Holy Ghost, should 
fall into more grievous sins, treasuring up wrath against the Jay of wrath. For, doubtless, 
these satisfactory punishments greatly recall from sin, and check as it were with a bridle, 
and make penitents more cautious and watchful for the future; they are also remedies for 
the remains [Page 103] of sin, and, by acts of the opposite virtues, they remove the habits 
acquired by evil living. Neither indeed was there ever in the Church of God any way 
accounted surer to turn aside the impending chastisement of the Lord, than that men 
should, with true sorrow of mind, practise these works of penitence. Add to these things, 
that, whilst we thus, by making satisfaction, suffer for our sins, we are made conformable 
to Jesus Christ, who satisfied for our sins, from whom all our sufficiency is; having also 
thereby a most sure pledge, that if we suffer with him, we shall also be glorified with him. 
But neither is this satisfaction, which we discharge for our sins, so our own, as not to be 
through Jesus Christ. For we who can do nothing of ourselves, as of ourselves, can do all 
things, He cooperating, who strengthens us. Thus, man has not wherein to glory, but all 
our glorying is in Christ: in whom we live; in whom we merit; in whom we satisfy; 
bringing forth fruits worthy of penance, which from him have their efficacy; by him are 
offered to the Father; and through him are accepted by the Father. Therefore the priests of 
the Lord ought, as far as the Spirit and prudence shall suggest, to enjoin salutary and 
suitable satisfactions, according to the quality of the crimes and the ability of the penitent; 
lest, if haply they connive at sins, and deal too indulgently with penitents, by enjoining 
certain very light works for very grievous crimes, they be made partakers of other men 's 
sins. But let them have in view, that the satisfaction, which they impose, be not only for 
the preservation of a new life and a medicine of infirmity, but also for the avenging and 
punishing of past sins. For the ancient Fathers likewise both believe and teach, that the 
keys of the priests were given, not to loose only, but also to bind. But not therefore did 
they imagine that the sacrament of Penance is a tribunal of wrath or of punishments; even 
as no Catholic ever thought, by this kind of satisfactions on our parts, the efficacy of the 
merit and of the satisfaction of our Lord Jesus Christ is either obscured, [Page 104] or in 
any way lessened: which when the innovators seek to understand, they in such wise 
maintain a new o be the est penance, as to Fake away the entire efficacy and use of 
satisfaction. 
CHAPTER IX.  
On Works of Satisfaction. 
The Synod teaches furthermore, that so great is the liberality of the divine munificence, 
that we are able through Jesus Christ to make satisfaction to God the Father, not only by 
punishments voluntarily undertaken of ourselves for the punishment of sin, or by those 
imposed at the discretion of the priest according to the measure of our delinquency, but 
also, which is a very great proof of love, by the temporal scourges inflicted of God, and 
borne patiently by us.
 ON THE SACRAMENT OF EXTREME UNCTION
 It hath also seemed good to the holy Synod, to subjoin, to the preceding doctrine on 
penance, the following on the sacrament of Extreme Unction, which by the Fathers was 
regarded as being the completion, not only of penance, but also of the whole Christian 
life, which ought to be a perpetual penance. First, therefore, as regards its institution, It 
declares and teaches, that our most gracious Redeemer,--who would have his servants at 
all times provided with salutary remedies against all the weapons of all their enemies,--as, 
in the other sacraments, He prepared the greatest aids, whereby, during life, Christians 
may preserve themselves whole from every more grievous spiritual evil, so did He guard 
the close of life, by the sacrament of Extreme Unction, as with a most firm defence. For 
though our adversary seeks and seizes opportunities, all our life long, to be able in any 
way to devour our souls; yet is there no time wherein he strains more vehemently all the 
powers of his craft to ruin us utterly, and, if he can possibly, to make us fall even from 
trust in the mercy of God, than when he perceives the end of our life to be at hand. 
[Page 105] 
CHAPTER I.  
On the Institution of the Sacrament of Extreme Unction. 
Now, this sacred unction of the sick was instituted by Christ our Lord, as truly and 
properly a sacrament of the new law, insinuated indeed in Mark, but recommended and 
promulgated to the faithful by James the Apostle, and brother of the Lord. Is any man, he 
saith, sick among you ? Let him bring in the priests of the Church, and let them pray over 
him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: and the prayer of faith shall save the 
sick man; and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him. 
In which words, as the Church has learned from apostolic tradition, received from hand to 
hand, he teaches the matter, the form, the proper minister, and the effect of this salutary 
sacrament. For the Church has understood the matter thereof to be oil blessed by a bishop. 
For the unction very aptly represents the grace of the Holy Ghost with which the soul of 
the sick person is invisibly anointed; and furthermore that whose words, "By this 
unction," &c. are the form. 
CHAPTER II.  
On the Effect of this Sacrament. 
Moreover the thing signified and the effect of this sacrament are explained in those 
words; And the prayer of faith shall save the sick man, and the Lord shall raise him up, 
and if he be in sins they shall be forgiven him. For the thing here signified is the grace of 
the Holy Ghost; whose anointing cleanses away sins, if there be any still to be expiated, as 
also the remains of sins; and raises up and strengthens the soul of the sick person, by 
exciting in him a great confidence in the [Page 106] divine mercy; whereby the sick being 
supported, bears more easily the inconveniences and pains of his sickness; and more 
readily resists the temptations of the devil who lies in wait for his heel; and at times 
obtains bodily health, when expedient for the welfare of the soul. 
CHAPTER III.  
On the Minister of this Sacrament, and on the time when it ought to be administered. 
And now as to prescribing who ought to receive, and who to administer this sacrament, 
this also was not obscurely delivered in the words above cited. For it is there also shown, 
that the proper ministers of this sacrament are the Presbyters of the Church; by which 
name are to be understood, in that place, not the elders by age, or the foremost in dignity 
amongst the people, but, either bishops, or priests by bishops rightly ordained by the 
imposition of the hands of the priesthood. It is also declared, that this unction is to be 
applied to the sick, but to those especially who lie in such danger as to seem to be about to 
depart this life: whence also it is called the sacrament of the departing. And if the sick 
should, after having received this unction, recover, they may again be aided by the 
succour of this sacrament, when they fall into another like danger of death. Wherefore, 
they are on no account to be hearkened to, who, against so manifest and clear a sentence 
of the apostle James, teach, either that this unction is a human figment or is a rite received 
from the Fathers which neither has a command from Cod, nor a promise of grace: nor 
those who assert that it has already ceased, as though it were only to be referred to the 
grace of healing in the primitive church; nor those who say that the rite and usage which 
the holy Roman Church observes in the administration of this sacrament is repugnant to 
the sentiment of the apostle James, and that it is therefore to be changed [Page 107] into 
some other: nor finally those who affirm that this Extreme Unction may without sin be 
contemned by the faithful : for all these things are most manifestly at variance with the 
perspicuous words of so great an apostle. Neither assuredly does the Roman Church, the 
mother and mistress of all other churches, observe aught in administering this unction,--as 
regards those things which constitute the substance of this sacrament,--but what blessed 
James has prescribed. Nor indeed can there be contempt of so great a sacrament without a 
heinous sin, and an injury to the Holy Ghost himself. These are the things which this holy 
oecumenical Synod professes and teaches and proposes to all the faithful of Christ, to be 
believed and held, touching the sacraments of Penance and Extreme Unction. And it 
delivers the following canons to be inviolably preserved; and condemns and 
anathematizes those who assert what is contrary thereto. 
ON THE MOST HOLY SACRAMENT OF PENANCE
 CANON I.--If any one saith, that in the Catholic Church Penance is not truly and properly 
a sacrament, instituted by Christ our Lord for reconciling the faithful unto God, as often 
as they fall into sin after baptism; let him be anathema. 
CANON II.--If any one, confounding the sacraments, saith that baptism is itself the 
sacrament of Penance, as though these two Sacraments were not distinct, and that 
therefore Penance is not rightly called a second plank after shipwreck; let him be 
anathema. 
CANON III.--If any one saith, that those words of the Lord the Saviour, Receive ye the 
Holy Ghost, whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them, and whose sins you 
shall retain, they are retained, are not to be understood of the power of forgiving and of 
retaining sins in the Sacrament of penance, as the Catholic Church has always from the 
beginning understood them; but wrests them, contrary to the institution of this sacra ment, 
to the power of preaching the gospel; let him be anathema. 
[Page 108] CANON IV.--If any one denieth, that, for the entire and perfect remission of 
sins, there are required three acts in the penitent, which are as it were the matter of the 
sacrament of Penance, to wit, contrition, confession, and satisfaction, which are called the 
three parts of penance; or saith that there are two parts only of penance, to wit, the terrors 
with which the conscience is smitten upon being convinced of sin, and the faith, generated 
by the gospel, or by the absolution, whereby one believes that his sins are forgiven him 
through Christ; let him be anathema. 
CANON V.--If any one saith, that the contrition which is acquired by means of the 
examination, collection, and detestation of sins,--whereby one thinks over his years in the 
bitterness of his soul, by pondering on the grievousness, the multitude, the filthiness of his 
sins, the loss of eternal blessedness, and the eternal damnation which he has incurred, 
having therewith the purpose of a better life,--is not a true and profitable sorrow, does not 
prepare for grace, but makes a man a hypocrite and a greater sinner; in fine, that this 
(contrition) is a forced and not free and voluntary sorrow; let him be anathema. 
CANON VI.--If any one denieth, either that sacramental confession was instituted, or is 
necessary to salvation, of divine right; or saith, that the manner of confessing secretly to a 
priest alone, which the Church hath ever observed from the beginning, and doth observe, 
is alien from the institution and command of Christ, and is a human invention; let him be 
anathema. 
CANON VII.--If any one saith, that, in the sacrament of Penance, it is not necessary, of 
divine right, for the remission of sins, to confess all and singular the mortal sins which 
after due and diligent previous meditation are remembered, even those (mortal sins) 
which are secret, and those which are opposed to the two last commandments of the 
Decalogtie, as also the circumstances which change the species of a sin; but (saith) that 
such confession is only useful to instruct and console the penitent, and that it was of old 
only observed in order to impose a [Page 109] canonical satisfaction; or saith that they, 
who strive to confess all their sins, wish to leave nothing to the divine mercy to pardon ; 
or, finally, that it is not lawful to confess venial sins ; let him be anathema. 
CANON VIII.--If any one saith, that the confession of all sins, such as it is observed in 
the Church, is impossible, and is a human tradition to be abolished by the godly; or that 
all and each of the faithful of Christ, of either sex, are not obliged thereunto once a year, 
conformably to the constitution of the great Council of Lateran, and that, for this cause, 
the faithful of Christ are to be persuaded not to con fess during Lent; let him be anathema. 
CANON IX.--If any one saith, that the sacramental absolution of the priest is not a 
judicial act, but a bare ministry of pronouncing and declaring sins to be forgiven to him 
who confesses; provided only he believe himself to be absolved, or (even though) the 
priest absolve not in earnest, but in joke; or saith, that the confession of the penitent is not 
required, in order that the priest may be able to absolve him; let him be anathema. 
CANON X.--If any one saith, that priests, who are in mortal sin, have not the power of 
binding and of loosing; or, that not priests alone are the ministers of absolution, but that, 
to all and each of the faithful of Christ is it said: Whatsoever you shall bind upon earth 
shall be bound also in heaven; and whatsoever you shall loose upon earth, shall be loosed 
also in heaven; and, whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins 
you shall retain, they are retained; by virtue of which words every one is able to absolve 
from sins, to wit, from public sins by reproof only, provided he who is reproved yield 
thereto, and from secret sins by a voluntary confession; let him be anathema. 
CANON XI.--If any one saith, that bishops have not the right of reserving cases to 
themselves, except as regards external polity, and that therefore the reservation of cases 
hinders not but that a priest may truly absolve from reserved cases; let him be anathema. 
[Page 110] CANON XII.--If any one saith, that God always remits the whole punishment 
together with the guilt, and that the satisfaction of penitents is no other than the faith 
whereby they apprehend that Christ has satisfied for them; let him be anathema. 
CANON XIII.--If any one saith, that satisfaction for sins, as to their temporal punishment, 
is nowise made to God, through the merits of Jesus Christ, by the punishments inflicted 
by Him, and patiently borne, or by those enjoined by the priest, nor even by those 
voluntarily undertaken, as by fastings, prayers, almsdeeds, or by other works also of 
piety; and that, therefore, the best penance is merely a new life; let him be anathema. 
CANON XIV.--If any one saith, that the satisfaction, by which enitents redeem their sins 
through Jesus Christ, are not a worship of God, but traditions of men, which obscure the 
doctrine of grace, and the true worship of God, and the benefit itself of the death of 
Christ; let him be anathema. 
CANON XV.--If any one saith, that the keys are given to the Church, only to loose, not 
also to bind; and that, therefore, priests act contrary to the purpose of the keys, and 
contrary to the institution of Christ, when they impose punishments on those who confess; 
and that it is a fiction, that, after the eternal punishment, has, by virtue of the keys, been 
removed, there remains for the most part a temporal punishment to be discharged; let him 
be anathema. 
ON THE SACRAMENT OF EXTREME UNCTION
 CANON I.--If any one saith, that Extreme Unction is not truly and properly a sacrament, 
instituted by Christ our Lord, and promulgated by the blessed apostle James; but is only a 
rite received from the Fathers, or a human figment; let him be anathema. 
[Page 111] CANON II.--If any one saith, that the sacred unction of the sick does not 
confer grace, nor remit sin, nor comfort(h) the sick; but that it has already ceased, as 
though it were of old only the grace of working Cures; let him be anathema. 
CANON III.--If any one saith, that the rite and usage of Extreme Unction, which the holy 
Roman Church observes, is repugnant to the sentiment of the blessed apostle James, and 
that is therefore to be changed, and may, without sin, be contemned by Christians; let him 
be anathema. 
CANON IV.--If any one saith, that the Presbyters of the Church, whom blessed James 
exhorts to be brought to anoint the sick, are not the priests who have been ordained by a 
bishop, but the elders in each community, and that for this Cause a priest alone is not the 
proper minister of Extreme Unction; let him be anathema. 
DECREE ON REFORMATION.
 Proem.
 It is the office of bishops to admonish their subjects, especially those appointed to the 
cure of souls, of their duty. 
Whereas it is properly the office of bishops to reprove the vices of all who are subject to 
them, this will have to be principally their care,--that clerics, especially those appointed to 
the cure of souls, be blameless; and that they do not, with their connivance, lead a 
disorderly life: for if they suffer them to be of evil and corrupt conversation, how shall 
they reprove the laity for their vices, when they themselves can be by one word silenced 
by them, for that they suffer clerics to be worse than they? And with what freedom shall 
priests be able to correct laymen, when they have to answer silently to themselves, that 
they have committed the very things which they reprove? Wherefore, bishops shall charge 
their clergy, of whatsoever rank they be, that they be a guide to the people of God 
committed to them, in conduct, conservation, and doctrine; being mindful of that which is 
written, Be holy for I also am holy. And, agreeably to the admonition of the apostle; Let 
them not give [Page 112] offence to any man, that their ministry be not blamed; but in all 
things let them exhibit themselves as the ministers of God, lest that saying of the prophet 
be fulfilled in them, The priests of God defile the sanctuaries, and despise the law. But, in 
order that the said bishops may be able to execute this with greater freedom, and may not 
be hindered therein under any pretext whatever, the same sacred and holy, ocecumenical 
and general Synod of Trent, the same legate and nuncios of the Apostolic See presiding 
therein, has thought fit that these canons following be established and decreed. 
CHAPTER I.  
If any, being prohibited, or interdicted, or suspended, advance to orders, they shall be 
punished. 
Whereas it is more beseeming and safe for one that is subject, by rendering due obedience 
to those set over him, to serve in an inferior ministry, than, to the scandal of those set over 
him, to aspire to the dignity of a more exalted degree; to him, unto whom the ascent to 
sacred orders shall have been interdicted by his own prelate, from whatsoever cause, be it 
even on account of some secret crime, or in what manner soever, even extra-judicially; 
and to him who shall have been suspended from his own orders, or ecclesiastical degrees 
and dignities; no license, conceded against the will of that said prelate, for causing 
himself to be promoted, nor any restoration to former orders, degrees, dignities and 
honours, shall be of any avail. 
CHAPTER II.  
If a bishop shall confer any orders whatsoever on one not subject to him, be he even his 
own domestic, without the express consent of that individual's proper prelate, both shall 
be subjected to an appointed punishment. 
And forasmuch as certain bishops of churches which are in partibus infidelium, (in the 
districts of unbelievers), having [Page 113] neither clergy nor Christian people, and being 
in a manner wanderers, having no fixed see, and seeking not the things of Christ, but 
other's sheep without the knowledge of their own pastor, finding themselves prohibited by 
this holy Synod from exercising episcopal functions in the diocese of another, without the 
express permission of the ordinary of the place, and then only in regard of those who are 
subject to the said ordinary, do, by an evasion and in contempt of the law, of their own 
rashness choose as it were an episcopal chair in a place which is not of any diocese, and 
presume to mark with the clerical character, and to promote even to the sacred orders of 
the priesthood, any that come unto them, even though they have no commendatory letters 
from their own bishops, or prelates; whence it for the most part comes to pass, that, 
persons being ordained who are but little fit, and are uninstructed and ignorant, and who 
have been rejected by their own bishops as incapable and unworthy, they are neither able 
rightly to perform the divine offices, nor to administer the sacraments of the Church: none 
of the bishops, who are called titular, even though they may reside, or tarry in a place 
within no diocese, even though it be exempted, or in a monastery of whatsoever order, 
shall, by virtue of any privilege granted them to promote during a certain time such as 
come unto them, be able to ordain, or to promote to any sacred or minor orders, or even to 
the first tonsure, the subject of another bishop, even under the pretext of his being his 
domestic fed constantly at his own table, without the express consent of, or without letters 
demissory from that individual's own bishop. The contravener shall be ipso jure 
suspended during a year from the exercise of pontifical functions; and the person so 
promoted shall in like manner be suspended from the exercise of the orders so received, 
for as long as to his own prelate shall seem fit. 
[Page 114] 
CHAPTER III.  
The bishop may suspend his clerics, who have been improperly promoted by another, if 
he find them incompetent.
 The bishop may suspend, for the time that shall seem to him fit, from the exercise of the 
orders received, and may interdict from ministering at the altar, or from exercising the 
functions of any order, any of his clerics, especially those who are in sacred orders, who 
have been, without his previous examination and commendatory letters, promoted by any 
authority whatsoever; even though they shall have been approved of as competent by him 
who has ordained them, but whom he himself shall find but little fit and able to celebrate 
the divine offices, or to administer the sacraments of the Church. 
CHAPTER IV.  
No cleric shall be exempt from the correction of the bishop, even out of the time of 
visitation.
 All prelates of the churches, who ought diligently to apply themselves to correct the 
excesses of their subjects,-and from whose jurisdiction, by the statutes of this holy Synod, 
no cleric is, under the pretext of any privilege soever, considered screened, so as not to be 
able to be visited, punished and corrected, in accordance with the appointments of the 
canons,--provided those prelates be resident in their own churches,--shall have power, as 
delegates for this end of the Apostolic See, to correct and punish, even out of the times of 
visitation, all Secular clerics,--howsoever exempted, who would otherwise be subject to 
their jurisdiction,--for their excesses, crimes, and delinquencies, as often as, and 
whensoever there shall be need; no exemptions, declarations, customs, sentences, oaths, 
concordates, which only bind the authors thereof, being of any avail to the said clerics, 
[Page 115] or to their relatives, chaplains, domestics, agents, or to any others whatsoever, 
in view and in consideration of the said exempted clerics. 
CHAPTER V.  
The jurisdiction of Conservators is confined within certain limits. 
Moreover, whereas sundry persons, under the plea that divers wrongs and annoyances are 
inflicted on them in their goods, possessions, and rights, obtain certain judges to be 
deputed by means of letters conservatory, to protect and defend them from the said 
annoyances and wrongs, and to maintain and keep them in possession, or quasi
possession, of their goods, property, and rights, without suffering them to be molested 
therein; and whereas they pervert these letters, in many ways, to an evil meaning quite 
opposed to the intention of the donor;--therefore, these letters conservatory, whatsoever 
be their clauses or decrees, whatsoever be the judges deputed, or under whatsoever other 
kind of pretext or colour, these letters may have been granted, shall not avail any, of what 
dignity and condition soever, even though a Chapter, so as to screen the party from being 
capable of being, in criminal and mixed causes, accused and summoned, and from being 
examined and proceeded against before his own bishop, or other ordinary superior; or 
prevent him from being liable to be freely summoned before the ordinary judge, in the 
matter of any rights which may be pleaded as his from having been ceded to him. In civil 
causes also, if he be the plaintiff, it shall nowise be lawful for him to bring up any one for 
judgment before his own judges conservatory. And if, in those causes wherein he shall be 
the defendant, it shall happen that the conservator chosen by him shall be declared by the 
plaintiff to be one suspected by him, or if any dispute shall have arisen between the 
judges themselves, the conservator [Page 116] to wit and the ordinary, concerning 
competency of jurisdiction, the cause shall not be proceeded with, until by arbitrators, 
chosen in legal form, a decision shall have been come to relative to the said suspicion, or 
competency of jurisdiction. Neither shall these letters conservatory be of any avail to the 
said party's domestics--who are in the habit of screening themselves thereby--save to two 
only, and this provided they live at his proper cost. Neither shall any one enjoy the benefit 
of such letters longer than for five years. It shall also not be lawful for conservatory 
judges to have any fixed tribunal. As to causes which relate to wages and to destitute 
persons, the decree of this holy Synod thereupon shall remain in its full force. But general 
universities, colleges of doctors or scholars, places belonging to Regulars, as also 
hospitals wherein hospitality is actually exercised, and persons belonging to the said 
universities, colleges, places, and hospitals are not to be deemed included in this present 
canon, but are to be considered, and are, wholly exempted. 
CHAPTER VI.  
A penalty is decreed against clerics, who, being in sacred Orders, or holding benefices, do 
not wear a dress beseeming their Order. 
And forasmuch as, though the habit does not make the monk, it is nevertheless need ful 
that clerics always wear a dress suitable to their proper order, that by the decency of their 
outward apparel they may show forth the inward correctness of their morals; but to such a 
pitch, in these days, have the contempt of religion and the rashness of some grown, as 
that, making but little account of their own dignity, and of the clerical honour, they even 
wear in public the dress of laymen--setting their feet in different paths, one of God, the 
other of the flesh;-for this cause, all ecclesiastical persons, howsoever exempted, who are 
either in sacred orders or in possession of any manner of dignities, personates, or other 
offices, or benefices ecclesiastical; [Page 117] if, after having been admonished by their 
own bishop, even by a public edict, they shall not wear a becoming clerical dress, suitable 
to their order and dignity, and in conformity with the ordinance and mandate of the said 
bishop, they may, and ought to be, compelled thereunto, by suspension from their orders, 
office, benefice, and from the fruits, revenues, and proceeds of the said benefices; and 
also, if, after having been once rebuked, they offend again herein, (they are to be coerced) 
even by deprivation of the said offices and benefices; pursuant to the constitution of 
Clement V. published in the Council of Vienne, and beginning Quoniam, which is hereby 
renewed and enlarged. 
CHAPTER VII.  
Voluntary homicides are n ever to be ordained: in what manner involuntary homicides are 
to be ordained. 
Whereas too, he who has killed his neighbour on set purpose and by lying in wait for him, 
is to be taken away from the altar, (q) because he has voluntarily committed a homicide ; 
even though that crime have neither been proved by ordinary process of law, nor be 
otherwise public, but is secret, such an one can never be promoted to sacred orders; nor 
shall it be lawful to confer upon him any ecclesiastical benefices, even though they have 
no cure of souls; but he shall be for ever excluded from every ecclesiastical order, 
benefice, and office. But if it be alleged that the homicide was not committed purposely 
but accidentally, or when repelling force by force that he might defend himself from 
death, in such wise that, by a kind of right, a dispensation ought to be granted, even for 
the ministry of sacred orders, and of the altar, and for any kind of benefice whatever and 
dignity,-the case shall be committed to the Ordinary of the place, or, if there be a cause 
for it, to the metropolitan, or to the nearest bishop; who shall not be able [Page 118] to 
dispense, without having taking cognizance of the case, and after the prayers and 
allegations have been proved, and not otherwise. 
CHAPTER VIII.  
No one shall, by virtue of any privilege, punish the clerics of another. 
Furthermore, forasmuch as there are sundry persons,--some of whom even are true 
pastors, and have their own sheep,--who seek also to rule over the sheep of others, and at 
times give their attention in such wise to the subjects of others, as to neglect the care of 
their own; no one, even though he be of episcopal dignity, who may have by privilege the 
power of punishing the subjects of another, shall by any means proceed against clerics not 
subject to him,--especially against such as are in sacred orders,--be they guilty of crime 
ever so atrocious; except with the intervention of the proper bishop of the said clerics, if 
that bishop be resident in his own church, or of the person that may be deputed by the said 
bishop: otherwise, the proceedings, and all the consequences thereof, shall be wholly 
without effect. 
CHAPTER IX.  
The Benefices of one Diocese shall not, under any pretext, be united to the Benefices of 
another Diocese. 
And forasmuch as it is with very good reason that dioceses and parishes have been made 
distinct, and to each flock their proper pastors have been assigned, and to inferior 
churches their rectors, each to take care of his own sheep, that so ecclesiastical order may 
not be confounded, or one and the same church belong in some sort to two dioceses, not 
without grievous inconvenience to such as are subject thereunto; the benefices of one 
diocese, be they even parochial churches, perpetual vicarages, simple benefices, 
prestimonies, or prestimonial portions, shall [Page 119] not be united in perpetuity to a 
benefice, monastery, college, or even to a pious place, of another diocese, not even for the 
sake of augmenting divine worship, or the number of beneficiaries, or for any other cause 
whatsoever; thus herein explaining the decree of this holy Synod on the subject of these 
unions. 
CHAPTER X.  
Regular Benefices shall be conferred on Regulars. 
Benefices of Regulars that have been accustomed to be granted in title to professed 
Regulars, when they happen to become vacant by the death of the titulary incumbent, or 
by his resignation, or otherwise, shall be conferred on religious of that order only, or on 
persons who shall be absolutely bound to take the habit, and make that profession, and 
upon none others, that they may not wear a garment that is woven of woollen and linen 
together. 
CHAPTER XI.  
Those transferred to another order shall remain under obedience in enclosure, and shall be 
incapable of Secular Benefices. 
But forasmuch as Regulars, after being transferred from one order to another, ordinarily 
obtain permission easily from their superior to remain out of their monastery, whereby 
occasion is given of their wandering about and apostatizing; no prelate or superior of any 
order shall be allowed, by virtue of any faculty whatsoever, to admit any individual to the 
habit and to profession, except with the view that he shall remain perpetually in enclosure 
under obedience to his own superior, in the order itself to which he is transferred; and one 
so transferred, even though he be a canon Regular, shall be wholly incapable of Secular 
Benefices, even of cures. 
[Page 120] 
CHAPTER XII.  
No one shall obtain a right of patronage, except by means of a foundation, or an 
endowment. 
No one, moreover, of whatsoever ecclesiastical or Secular dignity, can, or ought to, 
obtain, or acquire a right of patronage, for any other reason whatever, but that he has 
founded, and built anew, a church, benefice, or chapel; or that he has competently 
endowed, out of his own proper and patrimonial resources, one already erected, which, 
however, is without a sufficient endowment. But, in case of such foundation or 
endowment, the institution thereof shall be reserved to the bishop, and not to some other 
inferior person. 
CHAPTER XIII.  
The Presentation shall be made to the Ordinary; otherwise the Presentation and Institution 
shall be null. 
Furthermore, it shall not be lawful for a patron, under pretext of any privilege whatsoever, 
to present any one, in any way, to the benefices which are under his right of patronage, 
except to the ordinary bishop of the place, to whom the providing for, or the institution to, 
the said benefice would, that privilege ceasing, of right belong; otherwise the presentation 
and institution, which may have followed, shall be null, and as such reputed. 
CHAPTER XIV.  
That the Mass, Order, and Reformation, shall be next treated of. 
The holy Synod declares, moreover, that, in the next Session, which It has already 
decreed is to beholden on the twenty-fifth [Page 121] day of January, of the ensuing year, 
MDLII,--It will, together with the sacrifice of the mass, also apply itself to, and treat of 
the sacrament of order, and that the subject of reformation will be prosecuted.

SESSION THE FIFTEENTH,
 Being the fifth under thc Sovereign Pontiff, Julius III., celebrated on the twenty-fifth day 
of January, MDLlI. 
DECREE FOR PROROGUING THE SESSION
 Whereas, in pursuance of the decrees made in the last Sessions, this holy and universal 
Synod has, during these days, most accurately and diligently treated of the things which 
relate to the most holy sacrifice of the mass, and to the sacrament of order, with the view 
that, in the Session held on this day, It might publish, as the Holy Ghost should have 
suggested, decrees on these subjects, and on the four articles concerning the most holy 
sacrament of the Eucharist, which had been finally deferred to this Session ; and whereas 
it was thought that, in the interim, there would have presented themselves at this sacred 
and holy Council those who call themselves Protestants, for whose sake It had deferred 
the publication of the said articles, and to whom It had given the public faith, or a safe
conduct, that they might come freely and without any hesitation; nevertheless, seeing that 
they have not as yet come, and the holy Synod has been petitioned in their name, that the 
publication which was to have been made on this day, be deferred to the following 
Session, an assured hope being held out that they will certainly be present long before that 
Session, upon receiving in the meanwhile a safe-conduct in a more ample form :-The 
same holy Synod, lawfully assembled in the Holy Ghost, the same Legate and Nuncios 
presiding, desiring nothing more ardently than to remove, from amongst the noble nation 
of Germany, all dissensions and schisms touchingreligion,and to provide for its 
tranquillity, peace and repose; being ready, should they come, both to receive [Page 122] 
them kindly, and to listen to them favourably, and trusting that they will come, not with 
the design of obstinately opposing the Catholic Faith, but of learning the truth, and that 
they will at last, as becomes those zealous for evangelical truth, acquiesce in the decrees 
and discipline of holy Mother Church; (this Synod) has deferred the next Session,--therein 
to publish and promulgate the matters aforesaid,--till the festival of St. Joseph, which will 
be on the nineteenth day of the month of March; in order that they may have sufficient 
time and leisure, not only to come, but also to propose, before that day arrives, 
whatsoever they may wish. And,- that It may take from them all cause for further delay, It 
freely gives and grants them the public faith,-or a safe-conduct, of the tenour and form 
hereafter set down. But it ordains and decrees, that, in the meantime, It will treat of the 
sacrament of matrimony,- and will give its decisions thereon, in addition to the 
publication of the above-named decrees, in the same Session, and will prosecute the 
subject of Reformation. 
SAFE-CONDUCT GIVEN TO THE PROTESTANTS
 The sacred and holy, ocecumenical and general Synod of Trent,-lawfully assembled in the 
Holy Ghost, the same Legate and Nuncios of the Apostolic See presiding therein,-
adhering to the safe-conduct given in the last Session but one, and enlarging it in the 
manner following,- certifies to all men,- that by the ten our of these presents, It grants and 
wholly concedes the public faith, and the fullest and most true security, which they entitle 
a safe-conduct, to all and singular the priests, electors,-princes, dukes, marquises, counts, 
barons, nobles, soldiers, commonalty, and to all other persons whatsoever, of what state, 
condition, or quality soever they may be, of the province and nation of Germany,- and to 
the cities and other places thereof, and to all other ecclesiastical and Secular persons,- 
especially those of the Confession of Augsburg,- who shall come, or shall be sent with 
them, to this General Council of Trent, and to those that shall set forth, or have already 
repaired hither,- by whatsoever name they are entitled, or may be designated,--to come 
freely to this city [Page 123] of Trent, and there to remain, abide, sojourn, and to propose, 
speak and treat of, examine and discuss, any matters whatsoever together with the said 
Synod, and freely to present and set forth all whatsoever they may think fit, and any 
articles what-ever, either in writing, or by word of mouth, and to explain, establish, and 
prove them by the sacred Scriptures, aiid by the words, passages, and reasons of the 
blessed Fathers, and to answer even, if it be needful, to the objections of the General 
Council; and to dispute, or to confer in charity, without any hindrance, with those who 
may have been selected by the Council, all opprobrious, railing, and contumelious 
laiiguage being utterly discarded; and in particular, that the controverted matters shall be 
treated of in the aforesaid Council of Trent, according to sacred Scripture, and the 
traditions of the apostles, approved Councils, the consent of the Catholic Church, and the 
authorities of the holy Fathers; with this further addition, that they shall not be punished 
under pretence of religion,- or of offences already committed, or that may be committed, 
in regard thereof; as also, that the divine offices shall not, on account of their presence, be 
in any way interrupted, either upon the road, or in any place during their progress, their 
stay, or their return, or in the city of Trent itself; and that, upon these matters being 
concluded, or before they are concluded,- if they, or any of them, shall wish, and 
whensoever such is their or his pleasure, or the command and leave of their superiors, to 
return to their own homes, they shall forthwith be able at their good pleasure,- to return 
freely and securely, without any let, obstacle, or delay, without injury done to their 
property, or to the honour also and persons of their attendants respectively,--notifying, 
however, this their purpose of withdrawing to those who shall be deputed hereunto by the 
said Synod, that so, without deceit or fraud, proper measures may be taken for their 
safety. The holy Synod also wills that all clauses whatsoever,- which may be necessary 
and useful for a full,- effectual, and sufficient security in coming, sojourning, and 
returning, be included and comprised, and be accounted as comprised, in this public faith 
and safe-conduct. It also expressly declares, with a view to their greater security, and the 
blessing of peace and reconciliation, that if, [Page 124] which God forbid, any one, or 
divers amongst them, should, either on the road when coming to Trent, or whilst 
sojourning at, or returning from, that same city, perpetrate or commit any heinous act, 
whereby the benefit of this public faith and assurance might be annulled and cease, that It 
wills and grants,- that the persons discovered in any such crime shall be forthwith 
punished by their own countrymen, and not by others, with a proportionate chastisement 
and a sufficient reparation, which the Synod on its part mayjustlyapprove of and 
commend-the form, conditions, and terms of the safe-conduct remaining wholly 
untouched thereby. It also reciprocally wills, that if, which God forbid, any one, or divers, 
of this Synod, should, either on the road, or whilst sojourning at, or returning therefrom, 
perpetrate or commit any heinous act, whereby the benefit of this public faith and 
assurance may be violated, or in any way set aside, the persons discovered in any such 
crime shall be forthwith punished by the Synod itself, and not by others,- with a 
proportionate chastisement and a sufficient reparation, which the Germans of the 
Confession of Augsburg, who may be present here at the time, may on their part justly 
approve of and commend,-the present form, conditions and terms of the safe-conduct 
remaining wholly untouched thereby. The said Synod also wills, that all and each of the 
ambassadors shall be allowed to go out of the city of Trent to take the air, as of ten as it 
shall be convenient or necessary, and to return thither; as also freely to send or despatch 
their messenger or messengers to any places whatsoever, according as their affairs may 
require, and to receive the said messengers or messenger, despatches or despatch, as often 
as they shall think fit; so as however one or more be associated therewith by the deputies 
of the Council,- to provide for the safety of the said couriers. And this safe-conduct and 
security shall stand good and endure, both from and during the time that they shall have 
been received under the care of the said Synod, and the protection of its agents; and 
further, after they have had a sufficient audience, and twenty days having expired after 
they have themselves asked, or after the Council, upon that audience had,- shall have 
given them notice, to return, It will, all deceit and fraud being entirely excluded, 
reconduct [Page 125] them, with God's help, from Trent to that place of safety which 
each may select for himself. All which things,- It promises and in good faith pledges 
Itself, shall be inviolably observed towards all and each of the faithful of Christ, towards 
all ecclesiastical and Secular princes, and towards all ecclesiastical and Secular persons, 
of whatsoever state and condition they may be, or by whatsoever name designated. 
Furthermore, It promises in sincere and good faith, without fraud or deceit, that the said 
Synod will neither openly nor covertly seek for any opportunity ; nor make use of, nor 
stiffer any one else to make use of, any authority, power, right, or statute, privilege of 
laws or canons, or of any Councils whatsoever, especially those of Constance and Sienna, 
under what form soever expressed,--to the prejudice in any way of this public faith, and 
niost full security, and of the public and free hearing, by this said Synod granted to the 
above-named;--derogating from the aforesaid in this regard and for this occasion. 
And if the holy Synod, or any member thereof,--or of their followers, of whatsoever 
condition, state or pre-eminence, shall violate --which may the Almighty forbid--the 
forms and terms of the security and safe- conduct as above set down, in any point or 
clause whatever, and a sufficient reparation shall not have forthwith followed,- and one 
that may with reason be approved of and praised by the (interested) parties themselves 
they may and shall hold the said Synod to have incurred all those penalties, which, by law 
human and divine, or by custom, the violators of such safe-conducts can possibly incur;-
without there being any excuse or contrary allegation in this regard.

[Page 126] 
SESSION THE SIXTEENTH,
 Being the sixth, and last under the Sovereign Pontiff, Julius III., celebrated on the twenty
eighth day of April, MDLII. 
DECREE FOR THE SUSPENSION OF THE COUNCIL
 The sacred and holy, oecumenical and general Synod of Trent, lawfully assembled in the 
Holy Ghost, the most reverend lords, Sebastian, Archbishop of Siponto, and Aloysius, 
Bishop of Verona, Apostolic Nuncios, presiding therein, as well in their own names as in 
that of the most reverend and illustrious lord, the Legate Marcellsu Crescenzio, Cardinal 
of the holy Roman Church, of the title of Saint Marcellus, who is absent by reason of a 
most grievous illness,--doubts not that it is well known to all Christians, that this 
ocecumenical Council of Trent was first convoked and assembled by Paul, of happy 
memory, and was afterwards, at the instance of the most august Emperor, Charles V., 
restored by our most holy lord, Julius III., for this cause especially, that It might bring 
back to its pristine state, religion which was miserably divided into diverse opinions in 
many parts of the world, and especially in Germany; and might amend the abuses and the 
most corrupt manners of Christians ; and whereas very many Fathers, without any regard 
to their personal labours and dangers, had for this end cheerfully assembled together from 
different countries, and the business was proceeded with earnestly and happily, in the 
midst of a great concurse of the faithful, and there was no slight hope that those Germans 
who had excited these novelties would come to the Council, and that so disposed as to 
acquiesce unanimously in the truthful reasons of the Church; when a kind of light, in fine, 
seemed to have dawned upon things; and the Christian commonwealth, before so cast
down and afflicted, began to lift up its head; of a sudden such tumults and wars were 
enkindled [Page 127] by the craft of the enemy of mankind, that the Synod was at much 
inconvenience compelled as it were to pause, and to interrupt its course, and all hope was 
taken away of further progress at that time; and so far was the holy Synod from 
remedying the evils and troubles existing amongst Christians, that, contrary to its 
intention, It irritated rather than calmed the minds of many. Whereas, therefore, the said 
holy Synod perceived that all places, and especially Germany, were in a flame with arms 
and discord; that almost all the German bishops, and in particular the Electoral Princes, 
had withdrawn from the Council, in order to provide for their own churches ; It resolved, 
not to struggle against so pressing a necessity, but to be silent till better times ; that so the 
Fathers, who could not now act, might return to their own churches to take care of their 
own sheep, and no longer wear away their time in unemployment, useless in both regards. 
And accordingly, for that the state of the times has so required, It decrees that the progress 
of this ocecumenial Synod of Trent shall be suspended during two years, as It doth 
suspend it by this present decree; with this condition however, that if things be settled 
sooner, and the former tranquillity restored, which It hopes will happen be fore long 
through the blessing of the all good and all powerful God, the progress of the Council 
shall be considered (as resumed, and) to have its full force, power and authority. But if, 
which may God forefend, the lawful impediments aforesaid shall not have been removed 
at the expiration of the two years, the said suspension shall, as soon as those impediments 
shall have ceased, be thereupon accounted removed, and the Council shall be, and be 
understood to be, restored to its full force and authority, without another fresh 
convocation thereof, the consent and authority of his Iloliness, and of the holy Aposotlic 
See, having been given to this decree. Meanwhile, however, this holy Synod exhorts all 
Christian princes, and all prelates, to observe, and respectively to cause to be observed, as 
far as they are concerned, in their own kingdoms, dominions, and churches, all and 
singular the things which have been hitherto ordained and decreed by this sacred 
oecumenical Council. 
[Page 128] 
BULL FOR THE CELEBRATION OF THE COUNCIL OF TRENT, UNDER THE 
SOVEREIGN PONTIFF, PIUS IV 
Paul, Bishop, servant of the servants of God, for the perpeual memory hereof.
 Immediately on being called, by the alone mercy of God, to the Government of the 
Church, though unequal to so great a burthen, casting the eyes of our mind over every part 
of the Christian commonweal, and beholding, not without great horror, how far and wide 
the pestilence of heresy and schism had penetrated, and how much the morals of the 
Christian people stood in need of correction; we began, as the duty of our office required, 
to apply our care and thoughts to the means of extirpating the said heresies, of doing away 
with so great and so pernicious a schism, and of amending morals so much corrupted and 
depraved. And whereas we were sensible that, for the healing of these evils, that remedy 
was the most suitable which this Holy See had been accustomed to apply, we formed the 
resolution of convoking, and, with God's help, of celebrating an ocecumenical and general 
Council. That Council had indeed been already indicted by our predecessors, Paul III., of 
happy memory, and by Julius, his successor; but, having been often hindered and 
interrupted from various causes, It could not be brought to a conclusion. For Paul, after 
having indicted it first for the city of Mantua, then for Vicenza, he, for certain reasons 
expressed in his letters, first of all suspended, and afterwards transferred it to Trent. Then, 
after that the time of Its celebration had been, for certain reasons, then also postponed, at 
length, the suspension having been removed, It was begun, in the said city of Trent But, 
after a few Sessions had been held, and certain decrees made, the said Council afterwards, 
for certain reasons, with the concurrence also of the Apostolic See, transferred Itself to 
Bologna. But Julius, who succeeded him, recalled it to the same city of Trent, at which 
time certain other decrees were made. But as fresh tumults were raised in the 
neighbouring parts of Germany, and a most fierce war was enkindled in Italy and France, 
the Council was again suspended [Page 129] and postponed; the enemy of mankind, to 
wit, striving, and throwing difficulties upon difficulties and hindrances in the way, to 
retard at least as long as possible, though unable entirely to prevent, a thing so 
advantageous to the Church. But how greatly, meanwhile, the heresies were increased and 
multiplied, and propagated, how widely schism spread, we can neither think of, nor tell 
without the greatest sorrow of mind. But at length the Lord, good and merciful, who is 
never so angry as not to remember mercy, vouchsafed to grant peace and unanimity to 
Christian kings and princes. Which opportunity being offered us, we have, relying on His 
mercy conceived the strongest hope that, by the said means of a Council, an end may be 
put to these so grievous evils of the Church. We, therefore, have judged that the 
celebration thereof is no longer to be deferred; to the end that schisms and heresies may 
be taken away; that morals may be corrected and reformed; that peace may be pre-served 
amongst Christian princes. Wherefore, upon mature deliberation had with our venerable 
brethren the Cardinals of the holy Roman Church, and having also acquainted with this 
our purpose our most dearly beloved sons in Christ, Ferdinand, Emperor elect of the 
Romans, and other kings and princes whom,--even as we had promised ourselves from 
their exceeding piety and wisdom,--we found very ready to aid in the celebration of the 
said Council: We,--to the praise, honour, and glory of Almighty God, and for the good of 
the Universal Church, and relying on and supported by the authority of God Himself, and 
of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, which (authority) we also exercise on earth,-indict 
a sacred oecumenical and general Council in the city of Trent for the next ensuing most 
sacred day of the Lord's Resurrection; and We ordain and appoint, that, all suspension 
soever removed, It be there celebrated. Wherefore, We do earnestly exhort and admonish 
in the Lord, and we do also strictly charge and command,--by virtue of holy obedience, 
and by the obligation of the oath which they have taken, and under the penalties which 
[Page 130] they know are appointed by the sacred canons against those who neglect to 
assemble at general Councils,--our venerable brethren of all nations, patriarchs, 
archbishops, bishops, and our beloved sons the abbots, and others who, by common law, 
or by privilege, or ancient custom, are allowed to sit, and give their opinion in a general 
Council, to meet, by the aforesaid day, there to celebrate a Council; unless they happen to 
be hindered by a lawful impediment, which impediment nevertheless they shall be bound 
to prove to the Synod by lawful proctors. We furthermore admonish all and each, whom it 
doth and may concern, that they fail not to be present at the Council. And we exhort and 
beseech our most dearly beloved sons in Christ, the Emperor elect of the Romans, and the 
other Christian kings and princes,--who it were sincerely to be wished could be present at 
the Council,--that, should they not be able to be themselves present thereat, they would 
send at least prudent, grave, and pious men as their ambassadors, to be present thereat in 
their name; and that they take diligent care, worthy of their piety, that the prelates of their 
kingdoms and dominions perform, without denial or delay, their duty to God and the 
Church at this so urgent a conjuncture: doubting not they will also provide that there be 
kept a safe and free passage through their kingdoms and dominions for the prelates and 
their domestics, attendants, and all others who are proceeding to or returning from the 
Council, and that they be treated and received in all places kindly and courteously; as we 
also will similarly provide as far as we are concerned, who have resolved not to omit 
anything that can by us, who have been placed in this position, be done towards the 
completion of so pious and salutary a work; seeking, as God knows, nothing else, 
proposing nothing else, in celebrating this Council, but the honour of God, the recovery 
and the salvation of the sheep that are scattered, and the perpetual tranquillity and repose 
of the Christian commonweal. And to the end that this letter, and the contents thereof may 
come to the knowledge of all whom it concerns, and that none may plead as an excuse 
that he knew not thereof, especially as there may not, perhaps, be free access to all, who 
ought to be made acquainted with this our letter: We will [Page 131] and ordain that, in 
the Vatican Basilica of the prince of the apostles, and in the Lateran Church, at the time 
when the people is wont to assemble there to be present at the solemnities of the mass, it 
be publicly read in a loud voice by officers of our court, or by certain public notaries; and 
that it be, after being read, affixed to the doors of the said churches, also to the gates of 
the apostolic Chancery, and to the usual place in the Campo di Fiore, where it shall for 
some time be left to be read by and made known to all men: and when removed thence, 
copies thereof shall remain affixed in those same places. For we will that, by being so 
read, published, and affixed, this letter shall oblige and bind, after an interval of two 
months from the day of being published and affixed, all and each of those whom it 
includes, even as if it had been communicated and read to them in person. And we ordain 
and decree, that, without any doubt, faith be given to copies thereof written, or 
subscribed, by the hand of a public notary, and guaranteed by the seal of some person 
constituted in ecclesiastical dignity. Wherefore, let no one infringe this our letter of 
indiction, statute, decree, precept, admonition and exhortation, or with rash daring go 
contrary thereunto. But if any one shall presume to attempt this, let him know that he will 
incur the indignation of Almighty God, and of His Blessed Apostles, Peter and Paul. 
Given at Rome, at Saint Peter's, in the year MDLX of the Lord's Incarnation, on the third 
of the calends of December, in the first year of our Pontificate.

DECREE FOR CELEBRATING THE COUNCIL
 Doth it please you, unto the praise and glory of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, Father,

religion, that the sacred, ocecumenical, and general Council of Trent, lawfully assembled

Christian peace? They answered: It pleaseth us.

SESSION THE EIGHTEENTH,
 Being the second under the Sovereign Pontiff, Pius IV., celebrated on the twenty-sixth 
day of February, MDLXII. 
DECREE ON THE CHOICE OF BOOKS; AND FOR INVITING ALL MEN ON THE 
PUBLIC FAITH TO THE COUNCIL
 The sacred and holy, oecumenical and general Synod of Trent,--lawfully assembled in the 
Holy Ghost, the same Legates of the Apostolic See presiding therein,--not confiding in 
human strength, but relying on the succour and assistance of our Lord Jesus Christ, who 
has promised that he would give to His Church a mouth and wisdom, hath especially in 
view to restore at length to its native purity and splendour, the doctrine of the Catholic 
faith, which is in many places defiled and obscured by the conflicting opinions of many 
who differ from each other; to bring back, to a better method of life, manners, which have 
divaricated from ancient usage; and to turn the heart of the fathers unto tke children, and 
the heart of the children unto the fathers. Whereas, then, first of all, it has noticed that the 
number of suspected and pernicious books, wherein an impure doctrine is Contained, and 
is disseminated far and wide, has in these days increased beyond measure, which indeed 
has been the cause that many censures have been, out of a godly zeal, published in divers 
provinces, and especially in the fair city of Rome,--and yet that no salutary remedy has 
availed against so great and pernicious a disorder; It hath thought good, that Fathers 
specially chosen for this inquiry, should carefully consider what ought to be done in the 
matter of censures and of books, and also in due time report thereon to this holy Synod; to 
the end that It may more easily separate the various and strange doctrines, as cockle from 
the wheat of Christian truth, and may more conveniently deliberate and determine, in 
regard thereof, that which shall seem best adapted to remove scruples from the minds of 
very many, and to do away with various causes of complaint. [Page 134] And the Synod 
wishes all this to come to the knowledge of all persons whatsoever, as by this present 
decree It doth make them cognizant thereof; in order that if any person may think himself 
in any way concerned, either in this matter of books and censures, or in the other things 
which It has declared beforehand are to be treated of in this General Council, he may not 
doubt but that he will be kindly listened to by the Holy Synod. And forasmuch as this said 
holy Synod heartily desires, and earnestly beseeches God for the things that are for the 
peace of the Church, that we all, acknowledging our common mother on earth, who 
cannot forget the sons of her womb, with one mouth may glorify Cod, and the Father of 
our Lord Jesus Christ; It invites and exhorts, by the bowels of the mercy of our same God 
and Lord, all who hold not communion with us, unto concord and reconciliation, and to 
come unto this holy Synod; to embrace charity, which is the bond of perfection, and to 
show forth the peace of Christ rejoicing in thoir hearts, whereunto they are called, lit one 
body. Wherefore, in hearing this voice, not of man, but of the Holy Ghost, let them not 
harden their hearts, but, walking not after their own sense, nor pleasing themselves, let 
them be moved and converted by this so charitable and salutary an admonition of their 
own mother; for, as the holy Synod invites, so will It embrace them with all proofs of 
love. Moreover, this same holy Synod has decreed, that the public faith may be granted in 
a general congregation, and that It shall have the same force, and shall be of the same 
authority and weight as if it had been given and decreed in public Session. 
INDICTION OF THE NEXT SESSION
 The same sacred and holy Synod of Trent, lawfully assembled in the Holy Ghost, the 
same Legates of the Apostolic See pre-[Page 135]siding therein, resolves and decrees, 
that the next ensuing Session be held and celebrated on the Thursday after the most sacred 
festival of the Ascension of our Lord, which will be on the fourteenth day of the month of 
May. 
SAFE-CONDUCT GRANTED TO THE GERMAN NATION
 In a General Congregation, on the fourth day of March, MDLXII. 
The sacred and holy, ocecumenical and general Synod of Trent,--lawfully assembled in 
the Holy Ghost, the same Legates of the Apostolic See presiding therein,--certifies to all 
men, that, by the tenour of these presents, It grants and wholly concedes the public faith, 
and the fullest and most true security, which they entitle a safe-conduct, to all and 
singular the priests, electors, princes, dukes, marquisses, counts, barons, nobles, soldiers, 
commonalty, and to all other persons whatsoever, of what state, condition, or quality 
soever they may be, of the province and nation of Germany, and to the cities and other 
places thereof, and to all the ecclesiastical and secular persons, especially those of the 
Confession of Augsburg, who shall come, or shall be sent with them to this General 
Council of Trent, and to those that shall set forth, or have already repaired hither, by 
whatsoever name they are entitled, or may be designated,--to Come freely to this city of 
Trent, and there to remain, abide, sojourn, and to propose, speak, and treat of, examine 
and discuss any matters whatsoever together with the said Synod, and freely to present 
and set forth all whatsoever they may think fit, and any articles whatever, either in writing 
or by word of mouth, and to explain, establish, and prove them by the sacred Scriptures, 
and by the words, passages, and reasons of the blessed Fathers, and to answer even, if it 
be needful, to the objections of the General Council, and to dispute, or to confer in 
charity, without any hindrance with those who have been selected by the Council, all 
opprobrious, railing, and contumelious language being utterly discarded; and, in 
particular, that the controverted matters shall be treated of, in the aforesaid Council of 
Trent, according to sacred Scripture, and the traditions of the apostles, [Page 136] 
approved Councils, the consent of the Catholic Church, and the authorities of the holy 
Fathers; with this further addition, that they shall not be punished under pretence of 
religion, or of offences already committed, or that may be committed, in regard thereof; 
as also, that the divine offices shall not, on account of their presence, be in any way 
interrupted, either upon the road, or in any place during their progress, their stay, or their 
return, or in the city of Trent itself ; and that, upon these matters being concluded, or 
before they are concluded, if they, or any of them, shall wish, and whensover such is their 
or his pleasure, or the command and leave of their superiors, to return to their own homes, 
they shall forthwith be able at their good pleasure, to return freely and securely, without 
any let, obstacle, or delay, without injury done to their property, or to the honour also and 
persons of their attendants respectively,--notifying, however, this their purpose of 
withdrawing, to those who shall be deputed hereunto by the said Synod, that so, without 
deceit or fraud, proper measures may be taken for their safety. The holy Synod also wills 
that all clauses whatsoever, which may be necessary and useful for a full, effectual, and 
sufficient security in coming, sojourning, and returning, be included and comprised, and 
be accounted as comprised, in this public faith and safe-conduct. It also expressly 
declares, with a view to their greater security, and the blessing of peace and 
reconciliation, that if, which God forbid, any one, or divers amongst them, should, either 
on the road when coming to Trent, or whilst sojourning at, or returning from that same 
city, perpetrate or commit any heinous act, whereby the benefit of this public faith and 
assurance might be annulled and quashed, that It wills and grants, that the persons 
discovered in any such crime shall be forthwith punished by their own countrymen, and 
not by others, with a proportionate chastisement and a sufficient reparation, which the 
Synod on its part may justly approve of and commend,--the form, conditions, and terms 
of their safe-conduct remaining wholly untouched thereby. It also reciprocally wills, that 
if, which God forbid, any one, or divers, of this Synod, should, either on the road, or 
whilst sojourning at, or returning therefrom, perpetrate or commit any heinous act, [Page 
137] whereby the benefit of this public faith and assurance may be violated, or in any way 
set aside, the persons discovered in any such Crime shall be forthwith punished by the 
Synod itself, and not by others, with a proportionate chastisement and a sufficient 
reparation, which the Germans of the Confession of Augsburg, who may be present here 
at the time, may on their part justly approve of and commend,--the present form, 
Conditions, and terms of the safe-conduct remaining wholly untouched thereby. The said 
Synod also wills, that all and each of the ambassadors shall be allowed to go out of the 
City of Trent to take the air, as often as it shall be convenient or necessary, and to return 
thither; as also freely to send or despatch their messenger or messengers to any plaCes 
whatsoever, according as their affairs may require, and to receive the said messengers or 
messenger, despatches or despatch, as often as they shall think fit; so as however one or 
more be associated therewith by the deputies of the Council, to provide for the safety of 
the said couriers: and this safe-conduct and these securities shall stand good and endure, 
both from and during the time that they shall have been received under the Care of the 
said Synod, and the pro tection of its agents ; and further, after they have had a sufficient 
audience, and twenty days having expired after they have themselves asked, or after the 
Council, upon that audience had, shall have given them notice, to return, It will, all deceit 
and fraud being entirely excluded, reconduct them, with God's help, from Trent to that 
place of safety which each may select for himself. All which things It promises, and in 
good faith pledges Itself, shall be inviolably observed towards all and each of the faithful 
of Christ, towards all ecclesiastical and secular princes, and towards all other 
ecclesiastical and secular persons, of whatsoever state and condition they may be, or by 
whatsoever name designated. 
Furthermore, It promises in sincere and good faith, without fraud or deceit, that the said 
Synod will, neither openly nor covertly, seek for any opportunity, nor make use of, nor 
suffer any one else to make use of, any authority, power, right, or statute, privilege of 
laws or canons, or of any Councils whatsoever, especially those of Constance and Sienna, 
under [Page 138] what form soever expressed; to the prejudice in any way of this public 
faith, and most full security, and of the public and free hearing, by this said Synod granted 
to the above-named;--derogating from the aforesaid in this regard and for this occasion. 
And if the holy Synod, or any member thereof, or of their followers, of whatsoever 
condition, state, or pre-eminence, shall violate--which may the Almighty for fend-the 
form and terms of the security and safe-conduct as above set down, in any point or clause 
whatever, and a sufficient reparation shall not have forthwith followed, and one that may 
with reason be approved of and praised by the (interested) parties themselves; they may 
and shall hold the said Synod to have incurred all those penalties, which, by law human 
and divine, or by custom, the violators of such safe-conducts can possibly incur,--without 
there being any excuse, or Contrary allegation in this regard. 
EXTENSION THEREOF TO OTHER NATIONS
 The same sacred and holy Synod, lawfully assembled in the Holy Ghost, the same 
Legates a latere of the Apostolic See presiding therein, grants the public faith, or a safe
conduct, under the same form, and in the same terms, wherein it is granted to the 
Germans, to all and each of those others, who hold not communion with us in matters of 
faith, of whatsoever kingdoms, nations, provinces, Cities, and places they may be, 
wherein the contrary, to that which the holy Roman Church holds, is publicly and with 
impunity preached, taught, or believed.

SESSION THE TWENTY-FIRST,
 Being the fifth under the Sovereign Pontiff, Pius IV., celebrated on the sixteenth day of 
July, MDLXII. 
[DECREE ON COMMUNION UNDER BOTH SPECIES, AND THE COMMUNION 
OF INFANTS] 
Note: This title is missing in the Waterworth translation, 1848 edition. 
The sacred and holy, ocecumenical and general Synod of Trent,--lawfully assembled in 
the Holy Ghost, the same Legates of the Apostolic See presiding therein,-whereas, 
touching the tremendous and most holy sacrament of the Eucharist, there are in divers 
places, by the most wicked artifices of the devil, spread abroad certain monstrous errors, 
by reason of which, in some provinces, many are seen to have departed from the faith and 
obedience of the Catholic Church, It has thought fit, that what relates to communion 
under both species, and the com-munion of infants, be in this place set forth. Wherefore It 
forbids all the faithful in Christ to presume henceforth to believe, teach, or preach 
otherwise on these matters, than is in these decrees explained and defined. 
CHAPTER I.  
That laymen and clerics, when not sacrifising, are not bound, of divine right, to 
communion under both species. 
Wherefore, this holy Synod,--instructed by the Holy Spirit, who is the spirit of wisdom 
and of understanding, the spirit of counsel and of godliness, and following the judgment 
and usage of the Church itself,--declares and teaches, that laymen, and clerics when not 
consecrating, are not obliged, by any divine precept, to receive the sacrament of the 
Eucharist under both species ; and that neither can it by any means be doubted, without 
injury to faith, that communion under either species [Page 141] is sufficient for them unto 
salvation. For, although Christ, the Lord, in the last supper, instituted and delivered to the 
apostles, this venerable sacrament in the species of bread and wine; not therefore do that 
institution and delivery tend thereunto, that all the faithful of Church be bound, by the 
institution of the Lord, to receive both species. But neither is it rightly gathered, from that 
discourse which is in the sixth of John,-however according to the various interpretations 
of holy Fathers and Doctors it be understood,--that the communion of both species was 
enjoined by the Lord : for He who said; Except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and 
drink his blood, you shall not have life in you (v. 54), also said; He that eateth this bread 
shall live for ever (v. 59); and He who said, He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my 
blood hath everlasting life (v. 55), also said; The bread that I will give is my flesh for the 
life of (lie world (v. 52); and, in fine,- He who said; He that eateth my flesh and drinketh 
my blood, abideth in me and I in him (v. 57), said, nevertheless; He that eateth this bread 
shall live for ever (v. 59.) 
CHAPTER II.  
The power of the Church as regards the dispensation of the Sacrament of the Eucharist. 
It furthermore declares, that this power has ever been in the Church, that, in the 
dispensation of the sacraments, their substance being untouched, it may ordain,--or 
change, what things soever it may judge most expedient, for the profit of those who 
receive, or for the veneration of the said sacraments, according to the difference of 
circumstances, times, and places. And this the Apostle seems not obscurely to have 
intimated, when he says; Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and the 
dispensers of the mysteries of God. And indeed it [Page 142] is sufficiently manifest that 
he himself exercised this power,- as in many other things, so in regard of this very 
sacrament; when, after having ordained certain things touching the use thereof, he says; 
The rest I will set in order when I come. Wherefore, holy Mother Church, knowing this 
her authority in the administration of the sacraments, although the use of both species 
has,--from the beginning of the Christian religion, not been unfrequent, yet, in progress of 
time, that custom having been already very widely changed,--she, induced by weighty and 
just reasons,- has approved of this custom of communicating under one species, and 
decreed that it was to be held as a law; which it is not lawful to reprobate, or to change at 
plea sure, without the authority of the Church itself. 
CHAPTER III.  
That Christ whole and entire, and a true Sacrament are received under either species. 
It moreover declares, that although, as hath been already said, our Redeemer, in that last 
supper, instituted, and delivered to the apostles, this sacrament in two species, yet is to be 
acknowledged, that Christ whole and entire and a true sacrament are received under either 
species alone; and that therefore, as regards the fruit thereof, they, who receive one 
species alone, are not defrauded of any grace necessary to salvation. 
CHAPTER IV.  
That little Children are not bound to sacramental Communion.
 Finally, this same holy Synod teaches, that little children, who have not attained to the use 
of reason, are not by any necessity obliged to the sacramental communion of the 
Eucharist: [Page 143] forasmuch as, having been regenerated by th by the laver of 
baptism, and being incorporated with Christ, they cannot, at that age, lose the grace which 
they have already acquired of being the sons of God. Not therefore, however, is antiquity 
to be condemned, if, in some places, it, at one time, observed that custom; for as those 
most holy Fathers had a probable cause for what they did in respect of their times, so, 
assuredly, is it to be believed without controversy, that they did this without any necessity 
thereof unto salvation. 
ON COMMUNION UNDER BOTH SPECIES, AND ON THE COMMUNION OF 
INFANTS
 CANON I.--If any one saith, that, by the precept of God, or, by necessity of salvation, all 
and each of the faithful of Christ ought to receive both species of the most holy sacrament 
not consecrating; let him be anathema. 
CANON 11.--if any one saith, that the holy Catholic Church was not induced, by just 
causes and reasons, to communicate, under the species of bread only, laymen, and also 
clerics when not consecrating; let him be be anathema. 
CANON III.--If any one denieth, that Christ whole and entire -the fountain and author of 
all graces--is received under the one species of bread; because that-as some falsely assert-
He is not received, according to the institution of Christ himself, under both species; let 
him be anathema. 
CANON IV.--If any one saith, that the communion of the Eucharist is necessary for little 
children, before they have arrived at years of discretion; let him be anathema. 
As regards, however, those two articles, proposed on another occasion, but which have 
not as yet been discussed; to wit, whether the reasons by which the holy Catholic Church 
was led to communicate, under the one species of bread only, laymen, [Page 144] and 
also priests when not celebrating, are in such wise to be adhered to, as that on no account 
is the use of the chalice to be allowed to any one soever; and, whether, in case that, for 
reasons beseeming and consonant with Christian charity, it appears that the use of the 
chalice is to be granted to any nation or kingdom, it is to be conceded under certain 
conditions ; and what are those conditions: this same holy Synod reserves the same to 
another time,--for the earliest opportunity that shall present itself,--to be examined and 
defined. 
DECREE ON REFORMATION
 Proem.
 The same sacred and holy, oecumenical and general Synod of Trent,--lawfully assembled 
in the Holy Ghost, the same Legates of the Apostolic See presiding therein,-has thought 
fit that, to the praise of Almighty God, and the adornment of holy Church, the things 
which follow be ordained at present, touching the business of Reformation. 
CHAPTER I.  
Bishops shall both confer orders, and give dimissory letters and testimonials gratis: their 
servants shall receive nothing therefrom, and notaries that which is fixed in this decree.
 Forasmuch as the ecclesiastical order ought to be free from every suspicion of 
covetousness, neither bishops, nor others, who confer orders, nor their ministers, shall, 
under any pretext, receive anything for the collation of any manner of orders, not even for 
the clerical tonsure, nor for letters dimissory, or testimonials, nor for the seal, nor for any 
other cause whatsoever, [Page 145] not even though it should be voluntarily offered. And 
notaries, --in those places only where the laudable custom of not receiving any thing does 
not prevail,--shall only be able to receive thc tenth part of a golden crown (aureus) for 
each dimissory letter, or testimonial ; provided still that there be no salary assigned them 
for the discharge of this office; and provided that no emolument, out of the payments to 
the notary, Can accrue, either directly or indirectly, to the bishop from the collation of the 
said orders. For in this case the Synod ordains that they are bound to give their labour 
altogether gratuitously; utterly quashing and prohibiting all taxes to the contrary, and all 
statutes, and customs, even though immemorial, of all places whatsoever, [Page 145] 
which may rather be called abuses and corruptions tending to simoniacal pravity; and they 
who shall act otherwise, shall, as well the givers as the receivers, ipso facto, incur, besides 
the divine punishment, the penalties by law inflicted. 
CHAPTER II.  
Those who have not wherewith to live, are excluded from sacred Orders. 
Whereas it beseems not those who are enrolled in the divine ministry, to beg, or to 
exercise any sordid trade, to the disgrace of their order; and whereas it is well known that 
very many, and that in very many places, are admitted to sacred orders almost without 
any selection whatever; who, by various artifices and deceits, pretend to have an 
ecclesiastical benefice, or even means sufficient; the holy Synod ordains, that henceforth 
no secular cleric, though otherwise fit as regards morals, knowledge, and age, shall be 
promoted to sacred orders, unless it be first legitimately certain, that he is in the peaceful 
possession of an ecclesiastical benefice sufficient for his honest livelihood: and he shall 
not be able to resign that benefice, without mentioning that he was promoted under the 
title thereof; nor shall that resignation be received, unless it be certain that he can live 
[Page 146] conveniently from other sources; and any resignation made otherwise shall be 
null. As to those who have a patrimony, or a pension, they shall not henceforth be 
ordained, except such as the bishop shall consider ought to be received, in consideration 
of the necessity or the convenience of his churches; after having also first seen carefully 
to this, that they really enjoy that patrimony, or pension, and that they are such as to 
suffice for their sustenance: And the same may not in any case be alienated, extinguished, 
or remitted, without the permission of the bishop, until they shall have obtained a 
sufficient ecclesiastical benefice, or they shall have from some other source wherewith to 
live; renewing hereupon the penalties of the ancient canons. 
CHAPTER III.  
A method of increasing the daily distributions is prescribed; the persons to whom they 
shall be due: the contumacy of those who do not serve is punished. 
Whereas benefices were established in order to the performance of divine worship, and 
the offices of the Church; to the end that the divine worship may not in any respect be 
diminished, but due attention be paid thereunto in all things; the holy Synod ordains, that 
in churches, as well cathedral as collegiate, wherein there are no daily distributions, or so 
slight, that they are probably disregarded, a third part of the fruits and of all proceeds 
whatever, and revenues, as well of dignities, as of canonries, personates, portions, and 
offices, shall be set apart and converted to the purpose of daily distributions, to be divided 
amongst those who possess dignities and the others who are present at the divine service, 
according to that proportion which shall be settled by the bishop--even as the delegate of 
the Apostolic See--at the time of the very first deduction made from the fruits; saving, 
however, the customs of those churches wherein those who do not reside, or who do not 
serve, receive nothing, or less than a third: all exemptions, and any [Page 147] other 
customs, even though immemorial, and all appeals whatsoever notwithstanding. And 
upon the contumacy of those who do not serve increasing, they may be proceeded against 
according to the provision of the law, and of the sacred canons. 
CHAPTER IV.  
In what case Coadjutors are to be employed for the cure of souls.--The manner of erecting 
new parishes is set forth. 
In all parish churches, or those wherein baptism is administered, in which (churches) the 
people is so numerous, that one rector is not enough for the administration of the 
sacraments of the Church, and for the performance of divine worship, the bishops, even as 
delegates of the Apostolic See, shall compel the rectors, or others whom it may concern, 
to associate to themselves for this office, as many priests as shall be sufficient to 
administer the sacraments, and to celebrate the divine worship. As regards those churches, 
to which, on account of the distance, or the difficulties of the locality, the parishioners 
cannot, without great inconvenience, repair to receive the sacraments, and to hear the 
divine offices; the bishops may, even against the will of the rectors, establish new 
parishes, pursuant to the form of the constitution of Alexander III., which begins, Ad 
audientiam. And to those priests who shall have to be appointed afresh over the churches 
newly erected, a competent portion shall be assigned, according to the bishop's judgment, 
out of the fruits in any wise belonging to the Mother Church: and, if it be necessary, he 
may compel the people to contribute what may be sufficient for the sustenance of the said 
priests; every general or special reservation, or assignment, that may lie upon the said 
churches, notwithstanding. Neither shall ordinances and erections of this kind be 
prevented, or hindered, by means of any provisions, or even by virtue of any resignation, 
or by any other derogations, or suspensions whatsoever. 
[Page 148] 
CHAPTER V.  
Bishops shall be able to form perpetual unions, in the cases by law permitted. 
In order, also, that the state of those churches, wherein the sacred offices are administered 
unto God, may be maintained according to their dignity, the bishops, even as the 
delegates of the Apostolic See, may, according to form of law, make unions in perpetuity-
without prejudice, however, to the incumbents--of any parochial churches whatsoever, 
and of those wherein baptism is administered, and of other benefices with or without cure, 
with (other) cures, on account of the poverty of those churches, and in the other cases by 
law permitted; even though the said churches, or benefices, be generally or specially 
reserved, or in what way soever applied: the which unions shall not be capable of being 
revoked, by virtue of any provision whatever, not even on account of any resignation, or 
derogation, or suspension. 
CHAPTER VI.  
To ignorant Rectors, Vicars shall be, for the time being, deputed with a portion of the 
fruits; those continuing to give scandal may be deprived of their benefices. 
Forasmuch as illiterate and unskilful rectors of parish churches are but little fit for the 
sacred offices; and others, by reason of the turpitude of their lives, rather destroy than 
edify; the bishops, even as the delegates of the Apostolic See, may depute to the said 
illiterate and unskilful rectors, if they be otherwise of a blameless life, coadjutors, or 
vicars for the time being, and assign the same a part of the fruits for their sufficient 
maintenance, or provide for them in some other manner, setting aside any appeal or 
exemption whatsoever. But, those who live shamefully and scandalously, they shall, after 
having first admo-[Page 149]nished them, restrain and punish; and, if they shall still 
continue incorrigible in their wickedness, they shall have power to deprive them of their 
benefices, according to the constitutions of the sacred canons, setting aside every 
exemption or appeal whatsoever. 
CHAPTER VII.  
Bishops shall transfer, together with their obligations, churches which cannot be restored; 
others they shall cause to be repaired. 
Whereas, also, very great care ought to be taken, lest those things which have been 
dedicated to sacred services, may, through the injury of time, cease to be so employed, 
and pass from the memory of men; the bishops, even as the delegates of the Apostolic 
See, may transfer simple benefices--even those that are under a right of patronage-from 
churches which have fallen into ruin by age, or otherwise, and which cannot, by reason of 
the poverty thereof, be restored, to the Mother Churches, or others of the same or 
neighbouring places, as they shall judge fit, after having summoned those who are 
interested therein; and they shall raise, in the said churches, altars, or chapels, under the 
same invocations; or transfer them, with all their emoluments and with all the obligations 
that were imposed on the former churches, to altars or chapels already erected. But, as 
regards parish churches which have thus fallen into decay, they shall, even though they be 
under a right of patronage, make it their care that they be repaired and restored, out of any 
fruits and proceeds whatever, in any way belonging to the said churches; and if those 
resources should not be sufficient, they shall compel, by all suitable means, the patrons 
and others who receive any fruits derived from those churches, or, in their default, the 
parishioners, to provide for the aforesaid repairs; setting aside every appeal, exemption, or 
reservation whatsoever. But if they should be all too poor, those churches shall [Page 
150] be transferred to the Mother Churches, or to the neighbouring churches, with power 
to convert both the said parish churches and others that are in ruins, to profane, though not 
to sordid uses; a cross, however, being erected there. 
CHAPTER VIII.  
Commendatory monasteries, wherein regular observance is not in vigour, and all 
benefices so ever, shall be by bishops annually visited. 
It is right that whatsoever things in a diocese regard the worship of God, be diligently 
cared for by the Ordinary, and, where there is need, be by him set in order. Wherefore, 
monasteries held in commendam, even abbeys, priories, and those called provostries, 
wherein regular observance is not in vigour, as also benefices--with, or without the cure 
of souls, as well Regular as Secular-in whatever way held in commendam, even though 
exempt, shall be annually visited by the bishop, even as the delegates of the Apostolic 
See; and the said bishops shall provide, by suitable measures, even by the sequestration of 
the fruits, that what requires renewing or repairing, be done accordingly; and that the cure 
of souls, if those places, or those annexed to them, be charged therewith, as also that all 
other duties required of them, be rightly exercised; notwithstanding any appeals 
whatsoever, privileges, customs, even with a prescription from time immemorial, letters 
conservatory, commissions of judges, and their inhibitions to the contrary. And, if 
Regular observance be therein maintained, the bishops shall make it their care, by fatherly 
admonitions, that the superiors of the said Regulars observe, and cause to be observed, the 
manner of life required by the institutes of their order, and that they keep, and govern 
those subject to them, in their duty. And if, after having been admonished, they shall not, 
within six months, have visited or corrected them, then may the said bishops, even as 
delegates of the Apostolic See, visit and correct [Page 151] them, in the same way as the 
superiors themselves might do, in accordance with their institutes; notwithstanding, and 
completely setting aside, all appeals, privileges, and exemptions whatsoever. 
CHAPTER IX.  
The name and use of Questors of Alms is abolished.- The Ordinaries shall publish 
indulgences and spiritual graces.-- Two of the Chapters shall, without fee, receive the 
Alms. 
Whereas many remedies, heretofore applied by divers councils in their day, as well by 
that of Lateran, and of Lyons, as by that of Vienne, against the wicked abuses of questors 
of alms, have become in later times useless; yea, rather the depravity of such is, to the 
great scandal and complaint of all the faithful, found daily so to increase the more, as that 
there seems to be no longer any hope left of their amendment; (the Synod) ordains that, in 
all parts of Christendom soever, their name and use be henceforth utterly abolished; nor 
shall they be allowed in any wise to exercise any such office; notwithstanding any 
privileges granted to any churches, monasteries, hospitals, pious places, or to any persons 
of whatsoever degree, estate, and dignity, or any customs, even though immemorial. As 
regards the indulgences, or other spiritual graces, of which the faithful of Christ ought not 
on this account to be deprived, It decrees, that they are henceforth to be published to the 
people at the due times, by the Ordinaries of the places, aided by two members of the 
Chapter; to whom also power is given to gather faithfully the alms, and the succours of 
charity which are offered them, without their receiving any remuneration whatsoever; that 
so all men may at length truly understand, that these heavenly treasures of the Church are 
administered, not for gain, but for godliness. 
INDICTION OF THE NEXT SESSION
 The sacred and holy, oecumenical and general Synod of Trent, lawfully assembled in the 
Holy Ghost, the same Legates of the Apostolic See presiding therein, hath ordained and 
decreed, that the next ensuing Session be held and celebrated on the Thursday after the 
octave of the feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which will be on the 
seventeenth of the month of September next; with the addition, however, that the said 
holy Synod freely may and can, according to Its will and pleasure, as It shall judge 
expedient for the affairs of the Council, limit or extend, even in a general congregation, 
the said term, as also that which may be assigned hereafter for each Session.

SESSION THE TWENTY-SECOND,
 Being the sixth under the Sovereign Pontiff, Pius IV., celebrated on the seventeenth day 
of September, MDLXII. 
DOCTRINE ON THE SACRIFICE OF THE MASS.
 The sacred and holy, ecumenical and general Synod of Trent--lawfully assembled in the 
Holy Ghost, the same Legates of the Apostolic Sec presiding therein--to the end that the 
ancient, complete, and in every part perfect faith and doctrine touching the great mystery 
of the Eucharist may be retained in the holy Catholic Church; and may, all errors and 
heresies being repelled, be preserved in its own purity; (the Synod) instructed by the 
illumination of the Holy Ghost, teaches, declares; and decrees what follows, to be 
preached to the faithful, on the subject of the Eucharist, considered as being a true and 
singular sacrifice. 
[Page 153] 
CHAPTER I.  
On the institution of the most holy Sacrifice of the Mass.
 Forasmuch as, under the former Testament, according to the testimony of the Apostle 
Paul, there was no perfection, because of the weakness of the Levitical priesthood; there 
was need, God, the Father of mercies, so ordaining, that another priest should rise, 
according to the order of Melchisedech, our Lord Jesus Christ, who might consummate, 
and lead to what is perfect, as many as were to be sanctified. He, therefore, our God and 
Lord, though He was about to offer Himself once on the altar of the cross unto God the 
Father, by means of his death, there to operate an eternal redemption; nevertheless, 
because that His priesthood was not to be extinguished by His death, in the last supper, on 
the night in which He was betrayed,--that He might leave, to His own beloved Spouse the 
Church, a visible sacrifice, such as the nature of man requires, whereby that bloody 
sacrifice, once to be accomplished on the cross, might be represented, and the memory 
thereof remain even unto the end of the world, and its salutary virtue be applied to the 
remission of those sins which we daily commit,--declaring Himself constituted a priest for 
ever, according to the order of Melchisedech, He offered up to God the Father His own 
body and blood under the species of bread and wine; and, under the symbols of those 
same things, He delivered (His own body and blood) to be received by His apostles, 
whom He then constituted priests of the New Testament; and by those words, Do this in 
commemoration of me, He commanded them and their successors in the priesthood, to 
offer (them); even as the Catholic Church has always understood and taught. For, having 
celebrated the ancient Passover, which the multitude of the children of Israel immolated 
in memory of their going out of [Page 154] Egypt, He instituted the new Passover, (to 
wit) Himself to be immolated, under visible signs, by the Church through (the ministry of) 
priests, in memory of His own passage from this world unto the Father, when by the 
effusion of His own blood He redeemed us, and delivered us from the power of darkness, 
and translated us into his kingdom. And this is indeed that clean oblation, which cannot 
be defiled by any unworthiness, or malice of those that offer (it); which the Lord foretold 
by Malachias was to be offered in every place, clean to his name, which was to be great 
amongst the Gentiles; and which the apostle Paul, writing to the Corinthians, has not 
obscurely indicated, when he says, that they who are defiled by the participation of the 
table of devils, cannot be partakers of the table of the Lord; by the table, meaning in both 
places the altar. This, in fine, is that oblation which was prefigured by various types of 
sacrifices, during the period of nature, and of the law; in as much as it comprises all the 
good things signified by those sacrifices, as being the consummation and perfection of 
them all. 
CHAPTER II.  
That the Sacrifice of the Mass is propitiatory both for the living and the dead. 
And forasmuch as, in this divine sacrifice which is celebrated in the mass, that same 
Christ is contained and immolated in an unbloody manner, who once offered Himself in a 
bloody manner on the altar of the cross; the holy Synod teaches, that this sacrifice is truly 
propritiatory and that by means thereof this is effected, that we obtain mercy, and find 
grace in seasonable aid, if we draw nigh unto God, contrite and penitent, with a sincere 
heart and upright faith, with fear and reverence. For the Lord, appeased by the oblation 
thereof, and granting the [Page 155] grace and gift of penitence, forgives even heinous 
crimes and sins. For the victim is one and the same, the same now offering by the 
ministry of priests, who then offered Himself on the cross, the manner alone of offering 
being different. The fruits indeed of which oblation, of that bloody one to wit, are 
received most plentifully through this unbloody one; so far is this (latter) from derogating 
in any way from that (former oblation). Wherefore, not only for the sins, punishments, 
satisfactions, and other necessities of the faithful who are living, but also for those who 
are departed in Christ, and who are not as yet fully purified, is it rightly offered, agreebly 
to a tradition of the apostles. 
CHAPTER III.  
On Masses in honour of the Saints. 
And although the Church has been accustomed at times to celebrate, certain masses in 
honour and memory of the saints; not therefore, however, doth she teach that sacrifice is 
offered unto them, but unto God alone, who crowned them; whence neither is the priest 
wont to say, "I offer sacrifice to thee, Peter, or Paul;" but, giving thanks to God for their 
victories, he implores their patronage, that they may vouchsafe to intercede for us in 
heaven, whose memory we celebrate upon earth. 
CHAPTER IV  
On the Canon of the Mass. 
And whereas it beseemeth, that holy things be administered in a holy manner, and of all 
holy things this sacrifice is the most holy; to the end that it might be worthily and 
reverently [Page 156] offered and received, the Catholic Church instituted, many years 
ago, the sacred Canon, so pure from every error, that nothing is contained therein which 
does not in the highest degree savour of a certain holiness and piety, and raise up unto 
God the minds of those that offer. For it is composed, out of the very words of the Lord, 
the traditions of the apostles, and the pious institutions also of holy pontiffs. 
CHAPTER V.  
On the solemn ceremonies of the Sacrifice of the Mass. 
And whereas such is the nature of man, that, without external helps, he cannot easily be 
raised to the meditation of divine things; therefore has holy Mother Church instituted 
certain rites, to wit that certain things be pronounced in the mass in a low, and others in a 
louder, tone. She has likewise employed ceremonies, such as mystic benedictions, lights, 
incense, vestments, and many other things of this kind, derived from an apostolical 
discipline and tradition, whereby both the majesty of so great a sacrifice might be 
recommended, and the minds of the faithful be excited, by those visible signs of religion 
and piety, to the contemplation of those most sublime things which are hidden in this 
sacrifice. 
CHAPTER VI.  
On Mass wherein the priest alone communicates. 
The sacred and holy Synod would fain indeed that, at each mass, the faithful who are 
present should communicate, not only in spiritual desire, but also by the sacramental 
participation of the Eucharist, that thereby a more abundant fruit might be derived to them 
from this most holy sacrifice: but not therefore, if this be not always done, does It 
condemn, as private and unlawful, but approves of and therefore commends, [Page 157] 
those masses in which the priest alone communicates sacramentally; since those masses 
also ought to be considered as truly common; partly because the people communicate 
spiritually thereat; partly also because they are celebrated by a public minister of the 
Church, not for himself only, but for all the faithful, who belong to the body of Christ. 
CHAPTER VII.  
On the water that is to be mixed with the wine to be offered in the chalice. 
The holy Synod notices, in the next place, that it has been enjoined by the Church on 
priests, to mix water with the wine that is to be offered in the chalice; as well because it is 
believed that Christ the Lord did this, as also because from His side there came out blood 
and water; the memory of which mystery is renewed by this commixture; and, whereas in 
the apocalypse of blessed John, the peoples are called waters, the union of that faithful 
people with Christ their head is hereby represented. 
CHAPTER VIII.  
On not celebrating the Mass every where in the vulgar tongue; the mysteries of the Mass 
to be explained to the people. 
Although the mass contains great instruction for the faithful people, nevertheless, it has 
not seemed expedient to the Fathers, that it should be every where celebrated in the vulgar 
tongue. Wherefore, the ancient usage of each church, and the rite approved of by the holy 
Roman Church, the mother and mistress of all churches, being in each place retained; 
[Page 158] and, that the sheep of Christ may not suffer hunger, nor the little ones ask for 
bread, and there be none to break it unto them, the holy Synod charges pastors, and all 
who have the cure of souls, that they frequently, during the celebration of mass, expound 
either by themselves, or others, some portion of those things which are read at mass, and 
that, amongst the rest, they explain some mystery of this most holy sacrifice, especially 
on the Lord's days and festivals. 
CHAPTER IX.  
Preliminary Remark on the following Canons. 
And because that many errors are at this time disseminated and many things are taught 
and maintained by divers persons, in opposition to this ancient faith, which is based on 
the sacred Gospel, the traditions of the Apostles, and the doctrine of the holy Fathers; the 
sacred and holy Synod, after many and grave deliberations maturely had touching these 
matters, has resolved, with the unanimous consent of all the Fathers, to condemn, and to 
eliminate from holy Church, by means of the canons subjoined, whatsoever is opposed to 
this most pure faith and sacred doctrine. 
ON THE SACRIFICE OF THE MASS.
 CANON I.--If any one saith, that in the mass a true and proper sacriflce is not offered to 
God; or, that to be offered is nothing else but that Christ is given us to eat; let him be 
anathema. 
CANON II.--If any one saith, that by those words, Do this for the commemoration of me 
(Luke xxii. 19), Christ did not institute the apostles priests; or, did not ordain that they, 
and other priests should offer His own body and blood; let him be anathema. 
CANON III.--If any one saith, that the sacrifice of the mass is only a sacrifice of praise 
and of thanksgiving; or, that it is a [Page 159] bare commemoration of the sacrifice 
consummated on the cross, but not a propitiatory sacrifice; or, that it profits him only who 
receives; and that it ought not to be offered for the living and the dead for sins, pains, 
satisfactions, and other necessities; let him be anathema. 
CANON IV.--If any one saith, that, by the sacrifice of the mass, a blasphemy is cast upon 
the most holy sacrifice of Christ consummated on the cross; or, that it is thereby 
derogated from; let him be anathema. 
CANON V.--If any one saith, that it is an imposture to celebrate masses in honour of the 
saints, and for obtaining their intercession with God, as the Church intends; let him be 
anathema. 
CANON VI.--If any one saith, that the canon of the mass contains errors, and is therefore 
to be abrogated; let him be anathema. 
CANON VII.--If any one saith, that the ceremonies, vestments, and outward signs, which 
the Catholic Church makes use of in the celebration of masses, are incentives to impiety, 
rather than offices of piety; let him be anathema. 
CANON VIII.--If any one saith, that masses, wherein the priest alone communicates 
sacramentally, are unlawful, and are, therefore, to be abrogated; let him be anathema. 
CANON IX.--If any one saith, that the rite of the Roman Church, according to which a 
part of the canon and the words of consecration are pronounced in a low tone, is to be 
condemned; or, that the mass ought to be celebrated in the vulgar tongue only; or, that 
water ought not to be mixed with the wine that is to be offered in the chalice, for that it is 
contrary to the institution of Christ; let him be anathema. 
DECREE CONCERNING THE THINGS TO BE OBSERVED, AND TO BE 
AVOIDED, IN THE CELEBRATION OF MASS. 
What great care is to be taken, that the sacred and holy sacrifice of the mass be celebrated 
with all religious service and [Page 160] veneration, each one may easily imagine, who 
considers, that, in holy writ, he is called accursed, who doth the work of God negligently; 
and if we must needs confess, that no other work can be performed by the faithful so holy 
and divine as this tremendous mystery itself, wherein that life-giving victim, by which we 
were reconciled to the Father, is daily immolated on the altar by priests, it is also 
sufficiently clear, that all industry and diligence is to be applied to this end, that it be 
performed with the greatest possible inward cleanness and purity of heart, and outward 
show of devotion and piety. Whereas, therefore, either through the wickedness of the 
times, or through the carelessness and Corruption of men, many things seem already to 
have crept in, which are alien from the dignity of so great a sacrifice; to the end that the 
honour and cult due thereunto may, for the glory of God and the edification of the faithful 
people, be restored; the holy Synod decrees, that the ordinary bishops of places shall take 
diligent care, and be bound to prohibit and abolish all those things which either 
covetousness, which is a serving of idols, or irreverence, which can hardly be separated 
from impiety; or superstition, which is a false imitation of true piety, may have 
introduced. And that many things may be comprised in a few words: first, as relates to 
covetousness:--they shall wholly prohibit all manner of conditions and bargains for 
recompenses, and whatsoever is given for the celebration of new masses; as also those 
importunate and illiberal demands, rather than requests, for alms, and other things of the 
like sort, which are but little removed from a simonical taint, or at all events, from filthy 
lucre. 
In the next place, that irreverence may be avoided, each, in his own diocese, shall forbid 
that any wandering or unknown priest be allowed to celebrate mass. Furthermore, they 
shall not allow any one who is publicly and notoriously stained with crime, either to 
minister at the holy altar, or to assist at the sacred services; nor shall they suffer the holy 
sacrifice to be celebrated, either by any Seculars or Regulars whatsoever, in [Page 161] 
private houses; or, at all, out of the church, and those oratories which are dedicated solely 
to divine worship, and which are to be designated and visited by the said Ordinaries; and 
not then, unless those who are present shall have first shown, by their decently composed 
outward appearance, that they are there not in body only, but also in mind and devout 
affection of heart. They shall also banish from churches all those kinds of music, in 
which, whether by the organ, or in the singing, there is mixed up any thing lascivious or 
impure; as also all secular actions; vain and therefore profane conversations, all walking 
about, noise, and clamour, that so the house of God may be seen to be, and may be called, 
truly a house of prayer. 
Lastly, that no room may be left for superstition; they shall by ordinance, and under given 
penalties, provide, that priests do not celebrate at other than due hours; nor employ other 
rites, or other ceremonies and prayers, in the celebration of masses, besides those which 
have been approved of by the Church, and have been received by a frequent and 
praiseworthy usage. They shall wholly banish from the Church the observance of a fixed 
number of certain masses and of candles, as being the invention of superstitious worship, 
rather than of true religion; and they shall instruct the people, what is, and whence 
especially is derived, the fruit so precious and heavenly of this most holy sacrifice. They 
shall also admonish their people to repair frequently to their own parish churches, at least 
on the Lord's days and the greater festivals. All, therefore, that has been briefly 
enumerated, is in such wise propounded to all Ordinaries of places, as that, by the power 
given them by this sacred and holy Synod, and even as delegates of the Apostolic See, 
they may prohibit, ordain, reform, and establish, not only the things aforesaid, but also 
whatsoever else shall seem to them to have relation hereunto; and may compel the faithful 
people inviolably to observe them, by ecclesiastical censures and other penalties, which at 
their pleasure they may appoint; any privileges, exemptions, appeals, and customs 
whatsoever, to the contrary notwithstanding. 
[Page 162] 
DECREE ON REFORMATION.
 The same sacred and holy, ecumenical and general Synod of Trent,--lawfully assembled 
in the Holy Ghost, the same Legates of the Apostolic See presiding therein,--to the end 
that the business of reformation may be proceeded with, has thought good that the 
following things be ordained in the present Session. 
CHAPTER I.  
The Canons relative to the life, and propriety of conduct of Clerics are renewed. 
There is nothing that continually instructs others unto piety, and the service of God, more 
than the life and example of those who have dedicated themselves to the divine ministry. 
For as they are seen to be raised to a higher position, above the things of this world, others 
fix their eyes upon them as upon a mirror, and derive from them what they are to imitate. 
Wherefore clerics called to have the Lord for their portion, ought by all means so to 
regulate their whole life and conversation, as that in their dress, comportment, gait, 
discourse, and all things else, nothing appear but what is grave, regulated, and replete 
with religiousness; avoiding even slight faults, which in them would be most grievous; 
that so their actions may impress all with veneration. Whereas, therefore, the more useful 
and decorous these things are for the Church of God, the more carefully also are they to 
be attended to; the holy Synod ordains, that those things which have been heretofore 
copiously and wholesomely enacted by sovereign pontiffs and sacred councils,--relative 
to the life, propriety of conduct, dress, and learning of clerics, and also touching the 
luxuriousness, feastings, dances, gambling, sports, and all sorts of crime whatever, as also 
the secular employments, to be by them shunned,--the same shall be henceforth observed, 
under the same penalties, or greater, to be imposed at the discretion of the Ordinary; nor 
shall any appeal [Page 163] suspend the execution hereof, as relating to the correction of 
manners. But if anything of the above shall be found to have fallen into desuetude, they 
shall make it their care that it be brought again into use as soon as possible, and be 
accurately observed by all; any customs to the contrary notwithstanding; lest they 
themselves may have, God being the avenger, to pay the penalty deserved by their neglect 
of the correction of those subject to them. 
CHAPTER II.  
Who are to be promoted to Cathedral Churches. 
Whosoever is, hereafter, to be promoted to a cathedral church shall not only be fully 
qualified by birth, age, morals, and life, and, in other respects, as required by the sacred 
canons, but shall also have been previously constituted in sacred Order, for the space of at 
least six months. And information on these points, if the individual be only recently, or 
not at all, known at the court (of Rome), shall be derived from the Legates of the 
Apostolic See, or from the Nuncios of the provinces, or from his Ordinary, and in his 
default, from the nearest Ordinaries. And, besides the things above-named, he shall 
possess such learning as to be able to discharge the obligations of the office that is about 
to be conferred upon him; and he shall, therefore, have been previously promoted by 
merit, in some university for studies, to be a master, or doctor, or licentiate, in sacred 
theology, or in canon law; or shall be declared, by the public testimony of some academy, 
fit to teach others. And, if he be a Regular, he shall have a similar attestation from the 
superiors of his own order. And all the above-named persons, from whom the 
information, or testimony, aforesaid is to be derived shall be bound to report on these 
matters faithfully and gratuitously; otherwise let them know, that their conciences will be 
grievously burthened, and that God, and their own superiors, will punish them. 
[Page 164] 
CHAPTER III.  
Daily distributions, out of the third part of all fruits soever, are to be established; on 
whom the portion of absentees devolves; certa in cases excepted. 
Bishops, even as the delegates of the Apostolic See, shall have power to divide the third 
part of any manner of fruits and proceeds of all dignities, personates, and offices existing 
in cathedral or collegiate churches, into distributions, to be assigned as they shall judge 
fit; in such wise to wit, that, if those who ought to receive them should fail, on any 
appointed day, personally to discharge the duty that devolves upon them, according to the 
form that shall be prescribed by the said bishops, they shall forfeit that day's distribution, 
and shall acquire no manner of property therein, but it shall be applied to the fabric of the 
church, as far as it may need it, or to some other pious place, at the discretion of the 
Ordinary. But if their contumacy increase, they shall proceed against them according to 
the constitution of the sacred canons. But if any of the aforesaid dignitaries has, neither by 
right, nor custom, any jurisdiction, administration, or office, devolving upon him in the 
cathedral or collegiate churches; but, out of the city, in the same diocese, there is a cure of 
souls to be attended to, which he who holds that dignity is willing to take upon himself; in 
this case, during the time that he shall reside and minister in the church with that cure, he 
shall be considered as though he were present and assisted at the divine offices in those 
cathedral or collegiate churches. These things are to be understood as appointed for those 
churches only, wherein there is no custom, or statute, whereby the said dignitaries, who 
do not serve, lose something, which amounts to the third part of the said fruits and 
proceeds: any customs, even though immemorial, exemptions, and constitutions, even 
though confirmed by oath or by any authority whatsoever, to the contrary 
notwithstanding. 
[Page 165] 
CHAPTER IV.  
Those not initiated into a sacred Order, shall not have a voice in the chapter of any 
Cathedral or Collegiate Church. The qualifications and duties of those who hold 
Benefices therein. 
Whosoever being employed in the divine offices in a cathedral, or collegiate, Secular or 
Regular, church, is not constituted in the order of subdeaconship at least, shall not have a 
voice in the chapter of those churches, even though this may have been voluntarily 
conceded to him by the others. As to those who possess, or shall hereafter possess, in the 
said churches, any dignities, personates, offices, prebends, portions, and any other manner 
of benefices whatever, to which various obligations are annexed, such as, that some shall 
say, or sing, mass, others the Gospel, others the Epistle, they shall be bound, all just 
impediment ceasing, to receive the requisite orders within a year, whatsoever may be their 
privilege, exemption, prerogative, or nobility of birth; otherwise they shall incur the 
penalties enacted by the constitution of the Council of Vienne, which begins, Ut ii qui, 
which by this present decree is renewed: and the bishops shall compel them to exercise in 
person the aforesaid orders on the appointed days, and to discharge all the other duties 
required of them in the divine service, under the said penalties, and others even more 
grievous, which may be imposed at their discretion. Nor, for the future, shall any such 
office be assigned to any but those who shall be well known fully to have already the age 
and the other qualifications; otherwise such provision shall be null. 
CHAPTER V.  
Dispensations expedited out of the (Roman) court shall be committed to the Bishop, and 
be by him examined. 
Dispensations, by whatsoever authority they are to be granted, if they are to be consigned 
out of the Roman court, shall be [Page 166] consigned to the Ordinaries of those who 
shall have obtained them. And as to those dispensations which shall be granted as graces, 
they shall not have effect, until the said Ordinaries, as delegates of the Apostolic See, 
shall have first ascertained summarily only and extra-judicially, that the terms of the 
petition do not labour under the vice of surreption or obreption. 
CHAPTER VI  
Last intentions to be altered with caution. 
In alterations of last wills,--which alterations ought not to be made except for a just and 
necessary cause,--the bishops, as delegates of the Apostolic See, shall, before the 
alterations aforesaid are carried into execution, ascertain, that nothing has been stated in 
the prayer of the petition, which suppresses what is true, or suggests what is false. 
CHAPTER VII.  
The chapter "Romana," in the sixth (of the Decretals), is renewed. 
Apostolic legates and nuncios, patriarchs, primates, and metropolitans, in appeals 
interposed before them, shall, in all causes whatsoever, as well in admitting the appeals, 
as in granting inhibitions after an appeal, be bound to observe the form and tenour of the 
sacred constitutions, and especially of the constitution of Innocent IV., beginning 
Romana; any custom, even though immemorial, or usage, or privilege, to the contrary 
notwithstanding; otherwise the inhibitions and proceedings, and all the consequences 
thereof, shall be ipso jure null. 
[Page 167] 
CHAPTER VIII.  
Bishops shall execute the pious dispositions of all persons; shall visit all manner of pious 
places, if not under the immediate protection of Kings. 
The bishops, even as the delegates of the Apostolic See, shall, in the cases by law 
permitted, be the executors of all pious dispositions, whether made by last will, or 
between the living: they shall have a right to visit all manner of hospitals, colleges, and 
confraternities of laymen, even those which are called schools, or which go by any other 
name; but not, however, those places which are under the immediate protection of kings, 
except with their permission; also the eleemosynary institutions, called monts-de-piete, or 
of charity, and all pious places by whatsoever name designated, even though the aforesaid 
institutions be under the care of laymen, and though the said pious places be protected by 
a privilege of exemption; and, by virtue of their office, they shall take cognizance of, and 
see to the performance,--in accordance with the ordinances of the sacred canons,--of all 
things that have been instituted for God's worship, for the salvation of souls, or for the 
support of the poor; any custom, even though immemorial, or privilege, or statute 
whatsoever, to the contrary, notwithstanding. 
CHAPTER IX.  
Administrators of any pious places whatsoever shall give in their accounts to the 
Ordinary, unless it be otherwise provided by the foundation. 
The administrators, whether ecclesiastical, or lay, of the fabric of any church whatsoever, 
even though it be a cathedral, as also of any hospital, confraternity, charitable institution 
called [Page 168] mont-de-piete, and of any pious places whatsoever, shall be bound to 
give in, once a year, an account of their administration to the Ordinary: all customs and 
privileges to the contrary being set aside; unless it should happen that, in the institution 
and regulations of any church or fabric, it has been otherwise expressly provided. But if 
from custom, or privilege, or some regulation of the place, their account has to be 
rendered to others deputed thereunto, in that case the Ordinary shall also be employed 
jointly with them; and all acquittances given otherwise shall be of no avail to the said 
administrators. 
CHAPTER X.  
Notaries shall be subject to the examination and judgment of the Bishops. 
Whereas the unskilfulness of notaries causes very many injuries, and gives occasion to 
many lawsuits, the bishop, even as the delegate of the Apostolic See, may, by actual 
examination search into the competency of all notaries, even though created by apostolic, 
imperial, or royal authority; and, if such notaries be found incompetent, or on any 
occasion guilty of a delinquency in the discharge of their office, he may forbid them, 
altogether or for a time, to exercise that office, in ecclesiastical and spiritual affairs, 
lawsuits, and causes; nor shall any appeal on their parts suspend the prohibition of the 
Ordinary. 
CHAPTER XI.  
Usurpers of the property of any Church, or pious places, are punished. 
If any cleric, or layman, by whatsoever dignity pre-eminent, be he even emperor or king, 
should be so possessed by covetousness, that root of all evils, as to presume to convert to 
his own use, and to usurp,--by himself or by others, by force, or [Page 169] fear, or even 
by means of any supposititious persons, whether lay, or clerical, or by any artifice, or 
under any colourable pretext whatsoever,--the jurisdictions, property, rents, and rights, 
even those held in fee or under lease, the fruits, emoluments, or any sources of revenue 
whatsoever, belonging to any church, or to any benefice, whether Secular or Regular, 
monts-de-piete, or to any other pious places, which ought to be employed for the 
necessities of the ministers (thereof), and of the poor; or (shall presume) to hinder them 
(in any of the ways aforesaid) from being received by those unto whom they of right 
belong; he shall lie under an anathema until he shall have wholly restored to the Church, 
and to the administrator or beneficiary thereof, the jurisdictions, property, effects, rights, 
fruits, and revenues which he has seized upon, or in whatsoever way they have come to 
him, even by way of gift from a supposititious person and until he shall, furthermore, 
have obtained absolution from the Roman Pontiff. And if he be the patron of the said 
church, he shall, besides the penalties aforesaid, be thereupon deprived of the right of 
patronage. And the cleric who shall be the author of, or consenting to, any execrable fraud 
and usurpation of this kind, shall be subjected to the same penalties; as also he shall be 
deprived of all benefices whatsoever, and be rendered incapable of any others 
whatsoever; and ever after entire satisfaction and absolution, he shall be suspended from 
the exercise of his orders, at the discretion of his Ordinary. 
DECREE TOUCHING THE PETITION FOR THE CONCESSION OF THE CHALICE.
 Moreover, whereas the same sacred and holy Synod, in the preceding Session, reserved 
unto another time, for an opportunity that might present itself, two articles to be examined 
and defined, which (articles) had been proposed on another occasion, but had not then 
been as yet discussed, to wit, whether the reasons by which the holy Catholic Church was 
led to communicate, under the one species of bread, laymen and also priests [Page 170] 
when not celebrating, are in such wise to be adhered to, as that on no account is the use of 
the chalice to be allowed to any one soever; and, whether, in that case, for reasons 
beseeming and consonant with Christian charity, it appears that the use of the chalice is to 
be granted to any nation, or kingdom, it is to be conceded under certain conditions; and 
what are those conditions; It has now,--in Its desire that the salvation of those, on whose 
behalf the request is made, may be provided for in the best manner,--decreed, that the 
whole business be referred to our most holy lord, as by this present decree It doth refer it; 
who, of his singular prudence, will do that which he shall judge useful for the Christian 
commonweal, and salutary for those who ask for the use of the chalice. 
INDICTION OF THE NEXT SESSION.
 Moreover, this sacred and holy Synod of Trent appoints, for the day of the next Session, 
the Thursday after the octave of All Saints, which will be the twelfth day of the month of 
November; and thereon It will decree concerning the sacrament of Order, and the 
sacrament of Matrimony, &c. 
The Session was prorogued until the fifteenth day of July, MDLXIII.

SESSION THE TWENTY-THIRD,
 Being the seventh under the Sovereign Pontiff, Pius IV., celebrated on the fifteenth day of 
July, MDLXIII. 
THE TRUE AND CATHOLIC DOCTRINE, TOUCHING THE SACRAMENT OF 
ORDER, DECREED AND PUBLISHED BY THE HOLY SYNOD OF TRENT, IN THE 
SEVENTH SESSION, IN CONDEMNATION OF THE ERRORS OF OUR TIME. 
CHAPTER I.  
On the institution of the Priesthood of the New Law. 
Sacrifice and priesthood are, by the ordinance of God, in such wise conjoined, as that both 
have existed in every law. [Page 171] Whereas, therefore, in the New Testament, the 
Catholic Church has received, from the institution of Christ, the holy visible sacrifice of 
the Eucharist; it must needs also be confessed, that there is, in that Church, a new, visible, 
and external priesthood, into which the old has been translated. And the sacred Scriptures 
show, and the tradition of the Catholic Church has always taught, that this priesthood was 
instituted by the same Lord our Saviour, and that to the apostles, and their successors in 
the priesthood, was the power delivered of consecrating, offering, and administering His 
Body and Blood, as also of forgiving and of retaining sins. 
CHAPTER II.  
On the Seven Orders. 
And whereas the ministry of so holy a priesthood is a divine thing; to the end that it might 
be exercised in a more worthy manner, and with greater veneration, it was suitable that, in 
the most well-ordered settlement of the church, there should be several and diverse orders 
of ministers, to minister to the priesthood, by virtue of their office; orders so distributed as 
that those already marked with the clerical tonsure should ascend through the lesser to the 
greater orders. For the sacred Scriptures make open mention not only of priests, but also 
of deacons; and teach, in words the most weighty, what things are especially to be 
attended to in the Ordination thereof; and, from the very beginning of the church, the 
names of the following orders, and the ministrations proper to each one of them, are 
known to have been in use; to wit those of subdeacon, acolyth, exorcist, lector, and door
keeper; though these were not of equal rank: for the subdeavonship is classed amongst the 
greater orders by the Fathers and sacred Councils, wherein also we very often read of the 
other inferior orders. 
[Page 172] 
CHAPTER III.  
That Order is truly and properly a Sacrament. 
Whereas, by the testimony of Scripture, by Apostolic tradition, and the unanimous 
consent of the Fathers, it is clear that grace is conferred by sacred ordination, which is 
performed by words and outward signs, no one ought to doubt that Order is truly and 
properly one of the seven sacraments of holy Church. For the apostle says; I admonish 
thee that thou stir up the grace of God, which is in thee by the imposition of my hands. 
For God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of power and of love of sobriety. 
CHAPTER IV  
On the Ecclesiastical hierarchy, and on Ordination. 
But, forasmuch as in the sacrament of Order, as also in Baptism and Confirmation, a 
character is imprinted, which can neither be effaced nor taken away; the holy Synod with 
reason condemns the opinion of those, who assert that the priests of the New Testament 
have only a temporary power; and that those who have once been rightly ordained, can 
again become laymen, if they do not exercise the ministry of the word of God. And if any 
one affirm, that all Christians indiscrimately are priests of the New Testament, or that 
they are all mutually endowed with an equal spiritual power, he clearly does nothing but 
confound the ecclesiastical hierarchy, which is as an army set in array; as if, contrary to 
the doctrine of blessed Paul, all were apostles, all prophets, all evangelists, all pastors, all 
doctors. Wherefore, the holy Synod declares that, besides [Page 173] the other 
ecclesiastical degrees, bishops, who have succeeded to the place of the apostles, 
principally belong to this hierarchial order; that they are placed, as the same apostle says, 
by the Holy Ghost, to rule the Church of God; that they are superior to priests; administer 
the sacrament of Confirmation; ordain the ministers of the Church; and that they can 
perform very many other things; over which functions others of an inferior order have no 
power. Furthermore, the sacred and holy Synod teaches, that, in the ordination of bishops, 
priests, and of the other orders, neither the consent, nor vocation, nor authority, whether 
of the people, or of any civil power or magistrate whatsoever, is required in such wise as 
that, without this, the ordination is invalid: yea rather doth It decree, that all those who, 
being only called and instituted by the people, or by the civil power and magistrate, 
ascend to the exercise of these ministrations, and those who of their own rashness assume 
them to themselves, are not ministers of the church, but are to be looked upon as thieves 
and robbers, who have not entered by the door. These are the things which it hath seemed 
good to the sacred Synod to teach the faithful in Christ, in general terms, touching the 
sacrament of Order. But It hath resolved to condemn whatsoever things are contrary 
thereunto, in express and specific canons, in the manner following; in order that all men, 
with the help of Christ, using the rule of faith, may, in the midst of the darkness of so 
many errors, more easily be able to recognise and to hold Catholic truth. 
ON THE SACRAMENT OF ORDER.
 CANON I.--If any one saith, that there is not in the New Testament a visible and external 
priesthood; or that there is not any power of consecrating and offering the true body and 
blood of the Lord, and of forgiving and retaining sins; but only an office and bare 
ministry of preaching the Gospel, or, that those who do not preach are not priests at all; let 
him be anathema. 
[Page 174] CANON II.--If any one saith, that, besides the priesthood, there are not in the 
Catholic Church other orders, both greater and minor, by which, as by certain steps, 
advance is made unto the priesthood; let him be anathema. 
CANON III.--If any one saith, that order, or sacred ordination, is not truly and properly a 
sacrament instituted by Christ the Lord; or, that it is a kind of human figment devised by 
men unskilled in ecclesiastical matters; or, that it is only a kind of rite for choosing 
ministers of the word of God and of the sacraments; let him be anathema. 
CANON IV.--If any one saith, that, by sacred ordination, the Holy Ghost is not given; and 
that vainly therefore do the bishops say, Receive ye the Holy Ghost; or, that a character is 
not imprinted by that ordination; or, that he who has once been a priest, can again become 
a layman; let him be anathema. 
CANON V.--If any one saith, that the sacred unction which the Church uses in holy 
ordination, is not only not required, but is to be despised and is pernicious, as likewise are 
the other ceremonies of Order; let him be anathema. 
CANON VI.--If any one saith, that, in the Catholic Church there is not a hierarchy by 
divine ordination instituted, consisting of bishops, priests, and ministers; let him be 
anathema. 
CANON VII.--If any one saith, that bishops are not superior to priests; or, that they have 
not the power of confirming and ordaining; or, that the power which they possess is 
common to them and to priests; or, that orders, conferred by them, without the consent, or 
vocation of the people, or of the secular power, are invalid; or, that those who have 
neither been rightly ordained, nor sent, by ecclesiastical and canonical power, but come 
from elsewhere, are lawful ministers of the word and of the sacraments; let him be 
anathema. 
CANON VIII.--If any one saith, that the bishops, who are assumed by authority of the 
Roman Pontiff, are not legitimate and true bishops, but are a human figment; let him be 
anathema. 
DECREE ON REFORMATION
 The same sacred and holy Synod of Trent, prosecuting the matter of reformation, resolves 
and decrees that the things following be at present ordained. 
CHAPTER I.  
The negligence of Pastors of Churches in residing is variously punished: provision is 
made for the cure of souls. 
Whereas it is by divine precept enjoined on all, to whom the cure of souls is committed, 
to know their own sheep; to offer sacrifice for them; and, by the preaching of the divine 
word, by the administration of the sacraments, and by the example of all good works, to 
feed them; to have a fatherly care of the poor and of other distressed persons, and to apply 
themselves to all other pastoral duties; all which (offices) cannot be rendered and fulfilled 
by those who neither watch over nor are with their own flock, but abandon it after the 
manner of hirelings; the sacred and holy Synod admonishes and exhorts such, that 
mindful of the divine precepts, and made a pattern of the flock, they feed and rule in 
judgment and in truth. And for fear lest those things which have been already elsewhere 
holily and usefully ordained, concerning residence, under Paul III., of happy memory, 
may be wrested to a meaning alien from the mind of the sacred and holy Synod, as if by 
virtue of that decree it were lawful to be absent during five continuous months; the sacred 
and holy Synod, adhering to those decrees, declares, that all persons who are--under 
whatsoever name and title, even though they be cardinals of the holy Roman Church--set 
over any patriarchal, primatial, metropolitan, and cathe-[Page 176]dral churches 
whatsoever, are obliged to personal residence in their own church, or diocese, where they 
shall be bound to discharge the office enjoined them; and may not be absent thence, save 
for the causes and in the manner subjoined. For whereas Christian charity, urgent 
necessity, due obedience, and the evident utility of the Church, or of the commonwealth, 
require and demand that some at times be absent, this same sacred and holy Synod 
ordains, that these causes of lawful absence are to be approved of in writing by the most 
blessed Roman Pontiff, or by the metropolitan, or, in his absence, by the oldest resident 
suffragan bishop, whose duty it shall also be to approve of the absence of the 
metropolitan; except when such absence happens in consequence of some employment 
and office in the state attached to the bishoprics; the causes of which absence being 
notorious, and at times sudden, it will not be necessary even to notify them to the 
metropolitan; to whom it shall however belong, conjointly with the provincial Council, to 
judge of the permissions granted by himself, or by his suffragan, and to see that no one 
abuse that right, and that transgressors are punished with the penalties adjudged by the 
canons. Meanwhile let those about to depart remember to provide in such sort for their 
sheep, as that, as far as possible, they may not suffer any injury through their absence. 
But, forasmuch as those who are only absent for a short period, are, in the sense of the 
ancient canons, not supposed to be absent, for that they are about to return immediately; 
the sacred and holy Synod wills, that that term of absence, whether continuous or 
interrupted, ought not by any means to exceed two, or at most three, months; except for 
the causes above named; and that regard be had that it be done from a just cause, and 
without any detriment to the flock: which, whether it be the case, the Synod leaves to the 
conscience of those who withdraw themselves which It hopes will be religious and 
timorous; seeing that their hearts are open before God, whose work they are bound, at 
their periol, not to do deceitfully. In the meantime It [Page 177] admonishes and exhorts 
them in the Lord, that unless their episcopal duties call them to some other part of their 
own diocese, they on no account be absent from their own cathedral church during the 
period of the Advent of the Lord, and of Lent, on the days of the Nativity, of the Lord's 
Resurrection, of Pentecost, and of Corpus Christi, on which days especially the sheep 
ought to be refreshed, and to rejoice in the Lord at the presence of the Shepherd. 
But if any one, which it is hoped will never happen, shall be absent, contrary to the 
regulation of this decree, the sacred and holy Synod ordains, that, in addition to the other 
penalties imposed upon and renewed against non-residents, under Paul III., and the guilt 
of mortal sin which such an one incurs, he acquires no property in any fruits, in 
proportion to the time of his absence, and that he cannot, even though no other declaration 
but this follow, retain them as his with a safe conscience; but is bound, or, in his default, 
his ecclesiastical superior for him, to apply them to the fabric of the churches, or to the 
poor of the place; every kind of agreement, or composition as it is called, in regard of ill
gotten fruits, being prohibited, whereby the aforesaid fruits even might be wholly, or in 
part, restored to him; any privileges whatsoever, granted to any college or fabric, to the 
contrary notwithstanding. 
The same also, both as regards the guilt, the loss of fruits, and the penalties, does the 
sacred and holy Synod wholly declare and decree, in regard of inferior pastors, and all 
others whomsoever who hold any ecclesiastical benefice having cure of souls; in such 
wise, however, as that, whensoever it shall happen that they are absent, for a cause that 
has been first made known to, and been approved of by, the bishop, they shall leave, with 
a due allowance of stipend, a suitable vicar, to be approved of by the Ordinary. And they 
shall not obtain permission to be absent,--which is to be granted in writing and 
gratuitously,--for a larger period than two months, except for some weighty cause; and if, 
after having been cited, even though not per-[Page 178]sonally, by an edict, they shall be 
contumacious, the Synod wills, that it be in the power of the Ordinaries to constrain them 
by ecclesiastical censures, and by the sequestration and substraction of fruits, and by other 
legal remedies, even as far as deprivation; and that the execution hereof shall not be able 
to be suspended by any manner of privilege soever, license, claim as a domestic, 
exemption,--though even upon the ground of any manner of benefice,--by any compact, 
or statute,--even though confirmed by oath or by what authority soever,--by any custom, 
even though immemorial, which herein is to be looked upon rather as a corruption, or by 
any appeal, or inhibition, even in the Roman Court, or by virtue of the constitution of 
Eugenius. Finally, the holy Synod commands, that both the decree under Paul III., and 
this present, shall be published in the provincial and episcopal councils; for It desires that 
things so nearly concerning the office of pastors, and the salvation of souls, be frequently 
impressed on the minds and ears of all men, that so, with God's help, they may never 
hereafter be abolished through the injury of time, the forgetfulness of men, or by 
desuetude. 
CHAPTER II.  
Those set over Churches shall receive the rite of consecration within three months; where 
the consecration is to take place. 
Those who,--under whatsoever name or title, even though they be cardinals of the holy 
Roman Church,--have been set over cathedral, or superior, churches, if they shall not, 
within three months, have received the rite of consecration, shall be bound to restore the 
fruits which they have received; if they shall have neglected to do this within three other 
months afterwards, they shall be ipso jure deprived of their churches. And their 
consecration, if performed out of the Court of Rome, shall be celebrated in the church to 
which they have been promoted, or in the province, if it can be conveniently done. 
[Page 179] 
CHAPTER III.  
Bishops, except in case of illness, shall confer Order in person. 
Bishops shall themselves confer orders; but, should they be prevented by illness, they 
shall not send their subjects to another bishop for ordination, unless they have been 
already approved of and examined. 
CHAPTER IV  
Who are to be initiated by the first tonsure. 
None shall be initiated by the first tonsure, who have not received the sacrament of 
Confirmation; and who have not been taught the rudiments of the faith; and who do not 
know how to read and write; and in whose regard there is not a probable conjecture, that 
they have chosen this manner of life, that they may render unto God a faithful service, and 
not that they may fraudulently withdraw themselves from Secular jurisdiction. 
CHAPTER V  
Wherewith those who are to be ordained are to be furnished. 
Those who are to be promoted to minor orders shall have a good testimonial from their 
parish priest; and from the master of the school in which they are educated. As to those 
who are to be raised to any one of the greater orders, they shall, a month before 
ordination, repair to the bishop, who shall commission the parish priest, or such other 
person as may be deemed more expedient, to state publicly in the church the names and 
the desire of those who wish to be promoted; and to diligently inform himself, from 
persons worthy of credit, of the birth, age, morals, and life [Page 180] of those who are to 
be ordained, and shall transmit to the bishop himself, as soon as possible, letters 
testimonial containing the actual inquiry that has been made. 
CHAPTER VI  
The age of fourteen years is required for an ecclesiastical benfice; who is to enjoy the 
privilege of the (ecclesiastical) court. 
No one, after being initiated by the first tonsure, or even after being constituted in minor 
orders, shall be able to hold a benefice before his fourteenth year. Further, he shall not 
enjoy the privilege of the (ecclesiastical) court, unless he have an ecclesiastical benefice; 
or, wearing the ecclesiastical dress and tonsure, he serves in some church by the bishop's 
order, or lives with the bishop's permission in an ecclesiastical seminary, or in some 
school, or university, on the way as it were to receive the greater orders. As regards 
married clerks, the constitution of Boniface VIII., which begins, clerici qui cum unicis, 
shall be observed; provided the said clerks, being deputed by the bishop to the service or 
ministry of some church, serve and minister therein, and wear the clerical dress and 
tonsure: no privilege, or custom, even immemorial, availing any one herein. 
CHAPTER VII.  
Those to be ordained are to be examined by persons versed in divine and human laws. 
The holy Synod, adhering to the traces of the ancient canons, ordains, that when a bishop 
has arranged to hold an ordination, all who may wish to be received into the sacred 
ministry shall be summoned to the city, for the Thursday before the said ordination, or for 
such other day as the bishop shall think fit. [Page 181] And the bishop, calling to his 
assistance priests and other prudent persons, well skilled in the divine law, and of 
experience in the constitutions of the church, shall diligently investigate and examine the 
parentage, person, age, education, morals, learning, and faith of those who are to be 
ordained. 
CHAPTER VIII.  
How, and by whom, each ought to be ordained. 
Ordinations of sacred orders shall be celebrated publicly, at the time appointed by law, 
and in the cathedral churches, in the presence of the canons of that church, who are to be 
invited for that purpose; but, if they are celebrated in some other place of the diocese, in 
the presence of the clergy of the place; the principal church being always, as far as 
possible, made use of. But each one shall be ordained by his own bishop. And if any one 
ask to be promoted by another bishop, this shall by no means be allowed him, even under 
the pretext of any general or special rescript or privilege whatsoever, even at the 
appointed times; unless his probity and morals be recommended by the testimony of his 
own Ordinary; otherwise, he who ordains him shall be suspended from conferring orders 
during a year, and he who has been ordained shall be suspended from exercising the 
orders which he has received, for as long a period as shall seem expedient to his own 
Ordinary. 
CHAPTER IX.  
A bishop ordaining one of his own household, shall at once and really confer upon him a 
benefice. 
A bishop may not ordain one of his household, who is not his subject, unless he has lived 
with him for the space of [Page 182] three years; and he shall really, and without fraud of 
any kind, at once confer on him a benefice; any custom, even though immemorial, to the 
contrary notwithstanding. 
CHAPTER X.  
Prelates inferior to bishops shall not give the tonsure, or minor orders, save to Regulars 
their own subjects; neither shall they, nor any Chapters whatsoever, grant dimissory 
letters; a more grievous penalty is enacted against those who offend against this decree. 
It shall not henceforth be lawful for abbots, or for any other persons whatsoever, 
howsoever exempted, being within the limits of any diocese, even though they be said to 
be of no diocese, or to be exempted, to confer the tonsure, or minor orders on any one 
who is not a Regular subject to them; nor shall the said abbots, and other exempted 
persons, or any colleges, or Chapters whatsoever, even those of cathedral churches, grant 
letters dimissory to any Secular clerics to be ordained by others. But the ordination of all 
these persons shall appertain to the bishops within the limits of whose diocese they are, all 
things considered in the decrees of this holy Synod being observed; any privilege, 
prescriptions, or customs, even though immemorial, notwithstanding. And the Synod 
ordains, that the penalty imposed on those, who, contrary to the decree of this holy Synod 
under Paul III., obtain, during the vacancy of the episcopal See, letters dimissory from the 
Chapter, be also extended to those who shall obtain the said letters, not from the Chapter, 
but from any other persons whatsoever, who, during the vacancy of the See, succeed to 
the jurisdiction of the bishop, in lieu of the Chapter. And they who give dimissory letters, 
contrary to the form of this decree, shall be ipso jure suspended during a year from their 
office and benefice. 
[Page 183] 
CHAPTER XI.  
The interstices, and certain other regulations, to be observed in receiving minor orders. 
The minor orders shall not be given but to such as understand the Latin language at least, 
observing the appointed interstices of time, unless the bishop shall think it more expedient 
to act otherwise; that so they may be the more accurately taught how great is the 
obligation of this their state of life; and may exercise themselves in each office, agreeably 
to the appointment of the bishop; and this in the church to which they shall be assigned, 
unless they happen to be absent on account of their studies; and may thus ascend step by 
step: that so with their increasing age they may grow in worthiness of life and in learning; 
of which they will give proof especially by the example of their good conduct, by their 
assiduous service in the church, their greater reverence towards priests and the superior 
orders, and by a more frequent communion than heretofore of the Body of Christ. And 
whereas from these orders is the entrance unto higher orders and to the most sacred 
mysteries, no one shall be admitted thereunto, whom the promise of knowledge does not 
point out as worthy of the greater orders. And such shall not be promoted to sacred orders 
till a year after the reception of the last degree of minor orders; unless necessity, or the 
utility of the church, in the bishop's judgment, shall require otherwise. 
CHAPTER XII.  
Age required for the major orders; the deserving only to be admitted. 
No one shall for the future be promoted to the order of subdeaconship before the twenty
second year of age; to that [Page 184] of deaconship before his twenty-third year; to that 
of priesthood before his twenty-fifth year. Nevertheless, bishops are to know, that not all 
who have attained to that age must needs be admitted to the aforesaid orders, but those 
only who are worthy, and whose commendable life is an old age. Regulars likewise shall 
not be ordained under the above age, nor without a diligent examination by the bishop; all 
privileges whatsoever in this regard being completely set aside. 
CHAPTER XIII.  
On the conditions required in the Ordination of a Subdeacon and Deacon: on no one shall 
two sacred Orders be conferred on the same day. 
Such as have a good testimonial, and have been already tried in minor orders, and are 
instructed in letters, and in those things which belong to the exercise of their orders, shall 
be ordained subdeacons and deacons. They shall have a hope, with God's help, to be able 
to live continently; they shall serve in the churches to which they may be assigned; and 
are to know that it is very highly becoming that, after ministering at the altar, they should 
receive the sacred communion, at least on the Lord's days and solemnities. Those who 
have been promoted to the sacred order of the subdeaconship shall not, until they have 
remained therein during at least a year, be permitted to ascend to a higher degree, unless 
the bishop shall judge otherwise. Two sacred orders shall not be conferred on the same 
day, even upon Regulars; any privileges and indults whatsoever, to whomsoever granted, 
to the contrary notwithstanding. 
CHAPTER XIV.  
Who are to be raised to the Priesthood: their office. 
Those who have conducted themselves piously and faithfully in their precedent functions, 
and are promoted to the order of [Page 185] priesthood, shall have a good testimonial, 
and be persons who not only have served in their office of deacon during at least an entire 
year,--unless for the utility and the necessity of the Church, the bishop should judge 
otherwise,--but who have also been approved to be, by a careful previous examination, 
capable of teaching the people those things which it is necessary for all to know unto 
salvation, as also fit to administer the sacraments; and so conspicuous for piety and 
chasteness of morals, as that a shining example of good works and a lesson how to live 
may be expected from them. The bishop shall take care that they celebrate mass at least 
on the Lord's Days, and on solemn festivals; but, if they have the cure of souls, so often as 
to satisfy their obligation. The bishop may, for a lawful cause, grant a dispensation to 
those who have been promoted per saltum, provided they have not exercised the ministry 
(of that order). 
CHAPTER XV.  
No one shall hear confessions, unless he be approved of by the Ordinary. 
Although priests receive in their ordination the power of absolving from sins; 
nevertheless, the holy Synod ordains, that no one, even though he be a Regular, is able to 
hear the confessions of Seculars, not even of priests, and that he is not to be reputed fit 
thereunto, unless he either holds a parochial benefice, or is, by the bishops, after an 
examination if they shall think it necessary, or in some other manner, judged capable; and 
has obtained their approval, which shall be granted gratuitously; any privileges, and 
custom whatsoever, though immemorial, to the contrary notwithstanding. 
[Page 186] 
CHAPTER XVI.  
Those who are ordained shall be assigned to a particular church. 
Whereas no one ought to be ordained, who, in the judgment of his own bishop, is not 
useful or necessary for his churches, the holy Synod, adhering to the traces of the sixth 
canon of the council of Chalcedon, ordains, that no one shall for the future be ordained 
without being attached to that church, or pious place, for the need, or utility of which he is 
promoted; there to discharge his duties, and not wander about without any certain abode. 
And if he shall quit that place without consulting the bishop, he shall be interdicted from 
the exercise of his sacred (orders). Furthermore, no cleric, who is a stranger, shall, 
without letters commendatory from his own Ordinary, be admitted by any bishop to 
celebrate the divine mysteries, and to administer the sacraments. 
CHAPTER XVII.  
In what manner the exercise of the minor orders is to be restored. 
That the functions of holy orders, from the deacon to the janitor,-which functions have 
been laudably received in the Church from the times of the apostles, and which have been 
for some time interrupted in very many places,-may be again brought into use in 
accordance with the sacred canons; and that they may not be traduced by heretics as 
useless; the holy Synod, burning with the desire of restoring the pristine usage, ordains 
that, for the future, such functions shall not be exercised but by those who are actually in 
the said orders; and It exhorts in the Lord all and each of the prelates of the churches, and 
commands them, that it be their care to restore the said [Page 187] functions, as far as it 
can be conveniently done, in the cathedral, collegiate, and parochial churches of their 
dioceses, where the number of the people and the revenues of the church can support it; 
and, to those who exercise those functions, they shall assign salaries out of some part of 
the revenues of any simple benefices, or those of the fabric of the church,-if the funds 
allow of it,-or out of the revenues of both together, of which stipends they may, if 
negligent, be mulcted in a part, or be wholly deprived thereof, according to the judgment 
of the Ordinary. And if there should not be unmarried clerics at hand to exercise the 
functions of the four minor orders, their place may be supplied by married clerics of 
approved life; provided they have not been twice married, be competent to discharge the 
said duties, and wear the tonsure and the clerical dress in church. 
CHAPTER XVIII.  
Method of establishing Seminaries for Clerics, and of educating the same therein. 
Wereas the age of youth, unless it be rightly trained, is prone to follow after the pleasures 
of the world; and unless it be formed, from its tender years, unto piety and religion, before 
habits of vice have taken possession of the whole man, it never will perfectly, and without 
the greatest, and well-nigh special, help of Almighty God, persevere in ecclesiastical 
discipline; the holy Synod ordains, that all cathedral, metropolitan, and other churches 
greater than these, shall be bound, each according to its means and the extent of the 
diocese, to maintain, to educate religiously, and to train in ecclesiastical discipline, a 
certain number of youths of their city and diocese, or, if that number cannot be met with 
there, of that province, in a college to be chosen by the bishop for this purpose near the 
said churches, or in some other suitable place. Into this college shall be received such as 
are at least twelve years old, born in [Page 188] lawful wedlock, and who know how to 
read and write competently, and whose character and inclination afford a hope that they 
will always serve in the ecclesiastical ministry. And It wishes that the children of the poor 
be principally selected; though It does not however exclude those of the more wealthy, 
provided they be maintained at their own expense, and manifest a desire of serving God 
and the Church. The bishop, having divided these youths into as many classes as he shall 
think fit, according to their number, age, and progress in ecclesiastical discipline, shall, 
when it seems to him expedient, assign some of them to the ministry of the churches, the 
others he shall keep in the college to be instructed; and shall supply the place of those 
who have been withdrawn, by others; that so this college may be a perpetual seminary of 
ministers of God. And that the youths may be the more advantageously trained in the 
aforesaid ecclesiastical discipline, they shall always at once wear the tonsure and the 
clerical dress; they shall learn grammar, singing, ecclesiastical computation, and the other 
liberal arts; they shall be instructed in sacred Scripture; ecclesiastical works; the homilies 
of the saints; the manner of administering the sacraments, especially those things which 
shall seem adapted to enable them to hear confessions; and the forms of the rites and 
ceremonies. The bishop shall take care that they be present every day at the sacrifice of 
the mass, and that they confess their sins at least once a month; and receive the body of 
our Lord Jesus Christ as the judgment of their confessor shall direct; and on festivals 
serve in the cathedral and other churches of the place. 
All which, and other things advantageous and needful for this object, all bishops shall 
ordain-with the advice of two of the senior and most experienced canons chosen by 
himself-as the Holy Spirit shall suggest; and shall make it their care, by frequent 
visitations, that the same be always observed. The froward, and incorrigible, and the 
disseminators of evil morals, they shall punish sharply, even by expulsion if necessary; 
and, removing all hindrances, they shall carefully foster whatsoever appears to tend to 
preserve and advance so pious and holy an institution. And forasmuch as some certain 
revenues will be [Page 189] necessary, for raising the building of the college, for paying 
their salaries to the teachers and servants, for the maintenance of the youths, and for other 
expenses; besides those funds which are, in some churches and places, set apart for 
training or maintaining youths, and which are to be hereby looked upon as applied to this 
seminary under the said charge of the bishop; the bishops as aforesaid, with the advice of 
two of the Chapter,--of whom one shall be chosen by the bishop, and the other by the 
Chapter itself, and also of two of the clergy of the city, the election of one of whom shall 
in like manner be with the bishop, and of the other with the clergy,--shall take a certain 
part or portion, out of the entire fruits of the episcopal revenue, and of the chapter, and of 
all dignities whatsoever, personates, offices, prebends, portions, abbies, and priories, of 
whatsoever order, even though Regular, or of whatsoever quality, or condition they may 
be, and of hospitals which are conferred under title or administration, pursuant to the 
constitution of the Council of Vienne, which begins Quia contingit; and of all benefices 
whatsoever, even those belonging to Regulars, even those which are under any right of 
patronage, even those that are exempted, that are of no diocese, or are annexed to other 
churches, monasteries, hospitals, or to any other pious places, even such as are exempted; 
as also of the revenues devoted to the fabrics of churches, and of other places, and 
likewise of all other ecclesiastical revenues and proceeds whatsoever, even those of other 
colleges;-in which, however, there are not actually seminaries of scholars, or of teachers, 
for promoting the common good of the Church; for the Synod wills that those places be 
exempted, except in regard of such revenues as may remain over and above the suitable 
support of the said seminaries;--or of bodies, or confraternities, which in some places are 
called schools, likewise of all monasteries, with the exception of the Mendicants; also of 
the tithes in any way belonging to laymen, out of which ecclesiastical subsidies are wont 
to be paid; and those belonging to the soldiers of any [Page 190] military body, or order, 
the brethren of Saint John of Jerusalem alone excepted; and they shall apply to, and 
incorporate with, the said college this portion so deducted, as also a certain number of 
simple benefices, of whatsoever quality and dignity they may be, or even prestimonies, or 
prestimonial portions as they are called, even before they fall vacant, without prejudice 
however to the divine service, or to those who hold them. And this shall have effect, even 
though the benefices be reserved or appropriated to other uses; nor shall this union and 
application of the said benefices be suspended, or in any way hindered, by any resignation 
thereof, but shall still in any case have effect, notwithstanding any way whatever in which 
they may be vacated, even be it in the Roman court, and notwithstanding any constitution 
whatsoever to the contrary. 
The bishop of the place shall, by ecclesiastical censures, and other legal means, even by 
calling in for this purpose, if he think fit, the help of the Secular arm, compel the 
possessors of benefices, dignities, personates, and of all and singular the above-named 
(revenues), to pay this portion not merely on their own account, but also on account of 
whatsoever pensions they may happen to have to pay to others, out of the said revenues,
keeping back however a sum equivalent to that which they have to pay on account of 
those pensions: notwithstanding as regards all and singular the above-mentioned 
premises, any privileges, exemptions-even such as might require a special derogation-any 
custom, even immemorial, or any appeal, and allegation, which might hinder the 
execution hereof. But in case it should happen that, by means of the said unions being 
carried into effect, or from some other cause, the said seminary should be found to be 
wholly or in part endowed, then shall the portion, deducted as above from all benefices 
and incorporated by the bishop, be remitted, either wholly or in part, as the actual 
circumstances shall require. But if the prelates of cathedrals, and of the other greater 
churches, should be negligent in erecting the said seminary, and in preserving the same, 
and refuse to pay their share; it will be the duty of the archbishop sharply to reprove the 
bishop, and to compel him to comply with all the matters aforesaid, and of the provincial 
Synod to reprove and [Page 191] to compel in like manner the archbishop, and sedulously 
to provide that this holy and pious work be as soon as possible proceeded with, wherever 
it is possible. The bishop shall annually receive the accounts of the revenues of the said 
seminary, in the presence of two deputies from the Chapter, and of the same number 
deputed from the clergy of the city. 
Furthermore, in order that the teaching in schools of this nature may be provided for at 
less expense, the holy Synod ordains, that bishops, archbishops, primates, and other 
Ordinaries of places, shall constrain and compel, even by the substraction of their fruits, 
those who possess any dignities as professors of theology, and all others to whom is 
attached the office of lecturing, or of teaching, to teach those who are to be educated in 
the said schools, personally, if they be competent, otherwise by competent substitutes to 
be chosen by themselves, and to be approved of by the Ordinary. And if, in the judgment 
of the bishop, those chosen are not fit, they shall noniminate another who is fit, without 
any appeal being allowed; but should they neglect to do this, the bishop himself shall 
depute one. And the aforesaid masters shall teach those things which the bishop shall 
judge expedient. And, henceforth, those offices, or dignities, which are called 
professorships of theology, shall not be conferred on any but doctors, or masters, or 
licentiates in divinity, or canon law, or on other competent persons, and such as can 
personally discharge that office; and any provision made otherwise shall be null and void: 
all privileges and customs whatsoever, even though immemorial, notwithstanding. 
But if the churches in any province labour under so great poverty, as that a college cannot 
be established in certain (churches) thereof; the provincial Synod, or the metropolitan, 
aided by the two oldest suffragans, shall take care to establish one or more colleges, as 
shall be judged expedient, in the metro-[Page 192]politan, or in some other more 
convenient church of the province, out of the revenues of two or more churches, in which 
singly a college cannot conveniently be established, and there shall the youths of those 
churches be educated. 
But in churches which have extensive dioceses, the bishop may have one or more 
seminaries in the diocese, as to him shall seem expedient; which seminaries shall however 
be entirely dependent in all things on the one erected and established in the (episcopal) 
city. 
Finally, if, either upon occasion of the said unions, or the taxation, or assignment, and 
incorporation of the above-named portions, or from some other cause, there should 
happen to arise any difficulty, by reason of which the institution, or maintenance of the 
said seminary may be hindered or disturbed, the bishop with the deputies as above, or the 
provincial Synod according to the custom of the country, shall have power, regard being 
had to the character of the churches and benefices, to regulate and order all and singular 
the matters which shall seem necessary and expedient for the happy advancement of the 
said seminary, even so as to modify or enlarge, if need be, the contents hereof. 
INDICTION OF THE NEXT SESSION.
 Moreover, the same sacred and holy Synod of Trent indicts the next ensuing Session for 
the sixteenth day of the month of September; in which it will treat of the sacrament of 
Matrimony, and of such other matters, if there be any, relative to the doctrine of faith as 
can be expedited, as also on provisions for bishoprics, dignities, and other ecclesiastical 
benefices, and divers articles of Reformation.

SESSION THE TWENTY-FOURTH,
 Being the eighth under the Sovereign Pontiff, Pius IV., celebrated on the eleventh day of 
November, MDLXIII. 
DOCTRINE ON THE SACRAMENT OF MATRIMONY
 The first parent of the human race, under the influence of the divine Spirit, pronounced 
the bond of matrimony perpetual and indissoluble, when he said; This now is bone of my 
bones, and flesh of my flesh. Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother, and shall 
cleave to his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh. But, that by this bond two only are 
united and joined together, our Lord taught more plainly, when rehearsing those last 
words as having been uttered by God, He said, therefore now they are not two, but one 
flesh; and straightway confirmed the firmness of that tie, proclaimed so long before by 
Adam, by these words; What therefore God hath joined together, let no man put asunder. 
But, the grace which might perfect that natural love, and confirm that indissoluble union, 
and sanctify the married, Christ Himself, the institutor and perfecter of the venerable 
sacraments, merited for us by His passion; as the Apostle Paul intimates, saying: 
Husbands love your wives, as Christ also loved the Church, and delivered himself up for 
it; adding shortly after, This is a great sacrament, but I speak in Christ and in the Church. 
Whereas therefore matrimony, in the evangelical law, excels in grace, through Christ, the 
ancient marriages; with reason have our holy Fathers, the Councils, and the tradition of 
the universal Church, always taught, that it is to be numbered amongst the sacraments of 
the new law; against which, impious men of this age raging, have not only had false 
notions touching this venerable sacrament, but, introducing according to their wont, [Page 
194] under the pretext of the Gospel, a carnal liberty, they have by word and writing 
asserted, not without great injury to the faithful of Christ, many things alien from the 
sentiment of the Catholic Church, and from the usage approved of since the times of the 
apostles; the holy and universal Synod wishing to meet the rashness of these men, has 
thought it proper, lest their pernicious contagion may draw more after it, that the more 
remarkable heresies and errors of the above-named schismatics be exterminated, by 
decreeing against the said heretics and their errors the following anathemas. 
ON THE SACRAMENT OF MATRIMONY.
 CANON I.-If any one saith, that matrimony is not truly and properly one of the seven 
sacraments of the evangelic law, (a sacrament) instituted by Christ the Lord; but that it 
has been invented by men in the Church; and that it does not confer grace; let him be 
anathema. 
CANON II.-If any one saith, that it is lawful for Christians to have several wives at the 
same time, and that this is not prohibited by any divine law; let him be anathema. 
CANON III.-If any one saith, that those degrees only of consanguinity and affinity, which 
are set down in Leviticus, can hinder matrimony from being contracted, and dissolve it 
when contracted; and that the Church cannot dispense in some of those degrees, or 
establish that others may hinder and dissolve it ; let him be anathema. 
CANON IV.-If any one saith, that the Church could not establish impediments dissolving 
marriage; or that she has erred in establishing them; let him be anathema. 
CANON V.-If any one saith, that on account of heresy, or irksome cohabitation, or the 
affected absence of one of the parties, the bond of matrimony may be dissolved; let him 
be anathema. 
[Page 195] CANON VI.-If any one saith, that matrimony contracted, but not 
consummated, is not dissolved by the solemn profession of religion by one of the married 
parties; let him be anathema. 
CANON VlI.-If any one saith, that the Church has erred, in that she hath taught, and doth 
teach, in accordance with the evangelical and apostolical doctrine, that the bond of 
matrimony cannot be dissolved on account of the adultery of one of the married parties; 
and that both, or even the innocent one who gave not occasion to the adultery, cannot 
contract another marriage, during the life-time of the other; and, that he is guilty of 
adultery, who, having put away the adulteress, shall take another wife, as also she, who, 
having put away the adulterer, shall take another husband; let him be anathema. 
CANON VIII.-If any one saith, that the Church errs, in that she declares that, for many 
causes, a separation may take place between husband and wife, in regard of bed, or in 
regard of cohabitation, for a determinate or for an indeterminate period; let him be 
anathema. 
CANON IX.-If any one saith, that clerics constituted in sacred orders, or Regulars, who 
have solemnly professed chastity, are able to contract marriage, and that being contracted 
it is valid, notwithstanding the ecclesiastical law, or vow; and that the contrary is no thing 
else than to condemn marriage; and, that all who do not feel that they have the gift of 
chastity, even though they have made a vow thereof, may contract marriage; let him be 
anathema: seeing that God refuses not that gift to those who ask for it rightly, neither does 
He suffer us to be tempted above that which we are able. 
CANON X.-If any one saith, that the marriage state is to be placed above the state of 
virginity, or of celibacy, and that it is not better and more blessed to remain in virginity, 
or in celibacy, than to be united in matrimony; let him be anathema. 
CANON XI.-If any one saith, that the prohibition of the solemnization of marriages at 
certain times of the year, is a tyrannical superstition, derived from the superstition of the 
[Page 196] heathen; or, condemn the benedictions and other ceremonies which the 
Church makes use of therein; let him be anathema. 
CANON XII.-If any one saith, that matrimonial causes do not belong to ecclesiastical 
judges; let him be anathema. 
DECREE ON THE REFORMATION OF MARRIAGE
 CHAPTER I.  
The form prescribed in the Council of Lateran for solemnly contracting marriage is 
renewed.--Bishops may dispense with the bans.--Whosoever contracts marriage, 
otherwise than in the presence of the Parish Priest and of two or three witnesses, contracts 
it invalidly. 
Although it is not to be doubted, that clandestine marriages, made with the free consent of 
the contracting parties, are valid and true marriages, so long as the Church has not 
rendered them invalid; and consequently, that those persons are justly to be condemned, 
as the holy Synod doth condemn them with anathema, who deny that such marriages are 
true and valid; as also those who falsely affirm that marriages contracted by the children 
of a family, without the consent of their parents, are invalid, and that parents can make 
such marriages either valid or invalid; nevertheless, the holy Church of God has, for 
reasons most just, at all times detested and prohibited such marriages. But whereas the 
holy Synod perceives that those prohibitions, by reason of man's disobedience, are no 
longer of avail; and whereas it takes into account the grievous sins which arise from the 
said clandestine marriages, and especially the sins of those parties who live on in a state 
of damnation, when, having left their former wife, with whom they had contracted 
marriage secretly, they publicly marry another, and with her live in per-[Page 197]petual 
adultery; an evil which the Church, which judges not of what is hidden, cannot rectify, 
unless some more efficacious remedy be applied; wherefore, treading in the steps of the 
sacred Council of Lateran celebrated under Innocent III., it ordains that, for the future, 
before a marriage is contracted, the proper parish priest of the contracting parties shall 
three times announce publicly in the Church, during the solemnization of mass, on three 
continuous festival days, between whom marriage is to be celebrated; after which 
publication of banns, if there be no lawful impediment opposed, the marriage shall be 
proceeded with in the face of the church; where the parish priest, after having interrogated 
the man and the woman, and heard their mutual consent, shall either say, "I join you 
together in matrimony, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;" 
or, he shall use other words, according to the received rite of each province. But if upon 
occasion, there should be a probable suspicion that the marriage may be maliciously 
hindered, if so many publications of banns precede it; in this case either one publication 
only shall be made; or at least the marriage shall be celebrated in the presence of the 
parish priest, and of two or three witnesses: Then, before the consummation thereof, the 
banns shall be published in the church; that so, if there be any secret impediments, they 
may be the more easily discovered: unless the Ordinary shall himself judge it expedient, 
that the publications aforesaid be dispensed with, which the holy Synod leaves to his 
prudence and judgment. Those who shall attempt to contract marriage otherwise than in 
the presence of the parish priest, or of some other priest by permission of the said parish 
priest, or of the Ordinary, and in the presence of two or three witnesses; the holy Synod 
renders such wholly incapable of thus contracting and declares such contracts invalid and 
null, as by the present decree It invalidates and annuls them. Moreover It enjoins, that the 
parish priest, or any other priest, who shall have been [Page 198] present at any such 
contract with a less number of witnesses (than as aforesaid); as also the witnesses who 
have been present thereat without the parish priest, or some other priest; and also the 
contracting parties themselves; shall be severely punished, at the discretion of the 
Ordinary. Furthermore, the same holy Synod exhorts the bridegroom and bride not to live 
together in the same house until they have received the sacerdotal benediction, which is to 
be given in the church; and It ordains that the benediction shall be given by their own 
parish priest, and that permission to give the aforesaid benediction cannot be granted by 
any other than the parish priest himself, or the Ordinary; any custom, even though 
immemorial, which ought rather to be called a corruption, or any privilege to the contrary, 
notwithstanding. And if any parish priest, or any other priest, whether Regular or Secular, 
shall presume to unite in marriage the betrothed of another parish, or to bless them when 
married, without the permission of their parish priest, he shall-even though he may plead 
that he is allowed to do this by a privilege, or an immemorial custom,-remain ipso jure 
suspended, until absolved by the Ordinary of that parish priest who ought to have been 
present at the marriage, or from whom the benediction ought to have been received. 
The parish priest shall have a book, which he shall keep carefully by him, in which he 
shall register the names of the persons married, and of the witnesses, and the day on 
which, and the place where, the marriage was contracted. 
Finally, the holy Synod exhorts those who marry, that before they contract marriage, or, at 
all events, three days before the consummation thereof, they carefully confess their sins, 
and approach devoutly to the most holy sacrament of the Eucharist. 
If any provinces have herein in use any praise-worthy customs and ceremonies, besides 
the aforesaid, the holy Synod earnestly desires that they be by all means retained. 
And that these so wholesome injunctions may not be unknown [Page 199] to any, It 
enjoins on all Ordinaries, that they, as soon as possible, make it their care that this decree 
be published and explained to the people in every parish church of their respective 
dioceses; and that this be done as often as may be during the first year; and afterwards as 
often as they shall judge it expedient. It ordains, moreover, that this decree shall begin to 
be in force in each parish, at the expiration of thirty days, to be counted from the day of 
its first publication made in the said parish. 
CHAPTER II.  
Between whom Spiritual Relationship is contracted. 
Experience teaches, that, by reason of the multitude of prohibitions, marriages are 
ofttimes unwittingly contracted in prohibited cases, in which marriages either the parties 
continue to live on, not without great sin, or they are dissolved, not without great scandal. 
Wherefore, the holy Synod, wishing to provide against this inconvenience, and beginning 
with the impediment arising from spiritual relationship, ordains, that, in accordance with 
the appointments of the sacred canons, one person only, whether male or female, or at 
most one male and one female, shall receive in baptism the individual baptized; between 
whom and the baptized, and the father and mother thereof; as also between the person 
baptizing and the baptized, and the father and mother of the baptized; and these only; 
shall spiritual relationship be contracted. 
The parish priest, before he proceeds to confer baptism, shall carefully inquire of those 
whom it may concern, what person or persons they have chosen to receive from the 
sacred font the individual baptized, and he shall allow him or them only to receive the 
baptized; shall register their names in the book, and teach them what relationship they 
have contracted, that they may not have any excuse on the score of ignorance. [Page 200] 
And if any others, besides those designated, should touch the baptized, they shall not in 
any way contract a spiritual relationship; any constitutions that tend to the contrary 
notwithstanding. If through the fault or negligence of the parish priest any thing be done 
contrary hereto, he shall be punished, at the discretion of the Ordinary. That relationship, 
in like manner, which is contracted by confirmation shall not pass beyond him who 
confirms the person confirmed, his father and mother, and him who places his hand on 
him; all impediments arising from this kind of spiritual relationship between other persons 
being utterly set aside. 
CHAPTER III.  
The impediment of public honesty is confined within certain limits. 
The holy Synod entirely removes the impediment of justice arising from public honesty, 
whensoever espousals shall be, for whatsoever cause, not valid; but, when they are valid, 
the impediment shall not extend beyond the first degree; forasmuch as any such 
prohibition can no longer be observed, without injury, in more remote degrees. 
CHAPTER IV.  
Affinity arising from fornication is confined to the second degree. 
Moreover, the holy Synod, moved by the same and other most weighty reasons, limits, to 
those only who are connected in the first and second degree, the impediment contracted 
by affinity arising from fornication, and which dissolves the marriage that may have been 
afterwards contracted. It ordains [Page 201] that, as regards degrees more remote, this 
kind of affinity does not dissolve the marriage that may have been afterwards contracted. 
CHAPTER V.  
No one is to marry within the prohibited degrees: in what manner dispensation is to be 
granted therein. 
If any one shall presume knowingly to contract marriage within the prohibited degrees, he 
shall be separated, and be without hope of obtaining a dispensation; and this shall much 
the rather have effect in regard of him who shall have dared not only to contract such a 
marriage, but also to consummate it. But if he have done this in ignorance, but yet has 
neglected the solemnities required in contracting matrimony, he shall be subjected to the 
same penalties. For he who has rashly despised the wholesome precepts of the Church, is 
not worthy to experience without difficulty her bounty. But if, having observed those 
solemnities, some secret impediment be afterwards discovered, of which it was not 
unlikely that he should be ignorant, he may in this case more easily obtain a dispensation, 
and that gratuitously. As regards marriages to be contracted, either no dispensation at all 
shall be granted, or rarely, and then for a cause, and gratuitously. A dispensation shall 
never be granted in the second degree, except between great princes, and for a public 
cause. 
CHAPTER VI.  
Punishments inflicted on Abductors. 
The holy Synod ordains, that no marriage can subsist between the abducer and her who is 
abducted, so long as she shall remain in the power of the abducer. But if she that has been 
[Page 202] abducted, being separated from the abducer, and being in a safe and free 
place, shall consent to have him for her husband, the abducer may have her for his wife; 
but nevertheless the abduced himself and all who lent him advice, aid, and countenance, 
shall be ipso jure excommunicated, for ever infamous, and incapable of all dignities; and 
if they be clerics they shall forfeit their rank. The abducer shall furthermore be bound, 
whether he marry the person abducted, or marry her not, to settle on her a handsome 
dowry at the discretion of the judge. 
CHAPTER VII.  
Vagrants are to be married with caution. 
There are many persons who are vagrants, having no settled homes; and, being of a 
profligate character, they, after abandoning their first wife, marry another, and very often 
several in different places, during the life-time of the first. The holy Synod, being 
desirous to obviate this disorder, gives this fatherly admonition to all whom it may 
concern, not easily to admit this class of vagrants to marriage; and It also exhorts the civil 
magistrates to punish such persons severely. But It commands parish priests not to be 
present at the marriages of such persons, unless they have first made a careful inquiry, 
and, having reported the circumstance to the Ordinary, they shall have obtained 
permission from him for so doing. 
CHAPTER VIII.  
Concubinage is severely punished. 
It is a grievous sin for unmarried men to have concubines; but it is a most grievous sin, 
and one committed in special contempt of this great sacrament, for married men also to 
live in this state of damnation, and to have the audacity at times to [Page 203] maintain 
and keep them at their own homes even with their own wives. Wherefore, the holy Synod, 
that it may by suitable remedies provide against this exceeding evil, ordains that these 
concubinaries, whether unmarried or married, of whatsoever state, dignity, and condition 
they may be, if, after having been three times admonished on this subject by the Ordinary, 
even ex officio, they shall not have put away their concubines, and have separated 
themselves from all connexion with them, they shall be smitten with excommunication; 
from which they shall not be absolved until they have really obeyed the admonition given 
them. But if, regardless of this censure, they shall continue in concubinage during a year, 
they shall be proceeded against with severity by the Ordinary, according to the character 
of the crime. Women, whether married or single, who publicly live with adulterers or with 
concubinaries, if, after having been three times admonished, they shall not obey, shall be 
rigorously punished, according to the measure of their guilt, by the Ordinaries of the 
places, ex officio, even though not called upon to do so by any one; and they shall be cast 
forth from the city or diocese, if the Ordinaries shall think fit, calling in the aid of the 
Secular arm, if need be; the other penalties inflicted on adulterers and concubinaries 
remaining in their full force. 
CHAPTER IX.  
Temporal lords, or magistrates, shall not attempt anything contrary to the liberty of 
marriage. 
Earthly affections and desires do for the most part so blind the eyes of the understanding 
of temporal lords and magistrates, as that, by threats and ill-usage, they compel both men 
and women, who live under their jurisdiction,-especially such as are rich, or who have 
expectations of a great inheritance,-to contract marriage against their inclination with 
those whom the said lords or magistrates may prescribe unto them. Wherefore, seeing that 
it is a thing especially execrable to violate the liberty of matrimony, and that wrong comes 
from those from whom right is looked for, the holy Synod enjoins on all, of [Page 204] 
whatsoever grade, dignity, and condition they may be, under pain of anathema to be ipso 
facto incurred, that they put no constraint, in any way whatever, either directly or 
indirectly, on those subject to them, or any others whomsoever, so as to hinder them from 
freely contracting marriage. 
CHAPTER X.  
The solemnities of marriage are prohibited at certain times. 
The holy Synod enjoins, that the ancient prohibitions of solemn nuptials be carefully 
observed by all, from the Advent of our Lord Jesus Christ until the day of the Epiphany, 
and from Ash-Wednesday until the octave of Easter inclusively; but at other times It 
allows marriage to be solemnly celebrated; and the bishops shall take care that they be 
conducted with becoming modesty and propriety: for marriage is a holy thing, and is to be 
treated in a holy manner. 
DECREE ON REFORMATION
 The same sacred and holy Synod, prosecuting the subject of Reformation, ordains that the 
things following be established in the present Session. 
CHAPTER I.  
The manner of proceeding to the creation of Bishops and Cardinals. 
If, as regards all manner of degrees in the Church, a provident and enlightened care is to 
be taken, that in the house of the Lord there be nothing disorderly, nothing unseemly; 
much more ought we to strive that no error be committed in the election of him who is 
constituted above all those degrees. [Page 205] For the state and order of the whole 
household of the Lord will totter, if what is required in the body be not found in the head. 
For which cause, although the holy Synod has elsewhere usefully ordained certain things 
touching those who are to be promoted to cathedral and superior churches, yet doth it 
account this office to be of such a nature, as that were it to be pondered upon in 
proportion to its greatness, there would never seem to have been caution enough taken. 
Wherefore It ordains, that, as soon as a church shall become vacant, processions, and 
prayers shall be made in public and private; and such shall be enjoined, by the Chapter, 
throughout the city and diocese; that thereby both clergy and people may be enabled to 
obtain from God a good pastor. 
And as regards all and each of those who have, in any way, any right from the Apostolic 
See, or who otherwise have a part, in the promotion of those to be set over the churches; 
the holy Synod,-without making any change herein, from a consideration of the 
circumstances of the present time,-exhorts and admonishes them, that they above all 
things bear in mind that they cannot do anything more conducive to the glory of God, and 
the salvation of the people, than to study to promote good pastors, and such as are capable 
of governing a church; and that they sin mortally, becoming partakers in others' sins, 
unless they carefully endeavour that those be promoted whom they themselves judge the 
most worthy of, and useful to, the church, not guided by entreaties, or human affection, or 
the solicitations of pretenders, but by what the merits of the individuals require at their 
hands; and seeing that they be persons whom they know to have been born in lawful 
wedlock, and who, by their life, learning, and in all other qualifications, are such as are 
required by the sacred canons, and by the decrees of this Synod of Trent. 
And forasmuch as, by reason of the diversity of nations, peoples, and customs, a uniform 
system cannot be followed everywhere, in receiving the grave and competent testimony 
of [Page 206] good and learned men on the subject of the aforesaid qualifications, the 
holy Synod ordains, that, in a provincial Synod, to be held by the metropolitan, there shall 
be prescribed for each place and province a proper form of examination, scrutiny, or 
information, such as shall seem to be most useful and suitable for the said places, which 
form is to be submitted to the approval of the most holy Roman Pontiff; yet so, however, 
that, after that this examination, or scrutiny, as regards the persons to be promoted, shall 
have been completed, it shall, after being reduced into the form of a public document, be 
necessarily transmitted, as soon as possible, with all the attestations and with the 
profession of faith made by the individual to be promoted, to the most holy Roman 
Pontiff, in order that the said Sovereign Pontiff, having a full knowledge of the whole 
matter and of the persons, may, for the advantage of the Lord's flock, in a most useful 
manner provide those churches therewith, if they shall have been found, by the 
examination or scrutiny, suitable persons. And all the scrutinies, informations, 
attestations, and proofs of whatsoever kind, and by whomsoever made, even though in the 
Roman court, touching the qualifications of the person to be promoted, shall be carefully 
examined by a cardinal-who shall report thereon to the consistory-aided therein by three 
other cardinals; and the said report shall be authenticated by the signature of the cardinal 
who drew up the report, and of the three other cardinals; and therein each of the four 
cardinals shall make affirmation that, after giving exact attention thereto, he has found the 
persons to be promoted, endowed with the qualifications required by law, and by this holy 
Synod, and that, at the peril of his eternal salvation, he doth certainly think them fit to be 
placed over the churches: in such wise that, after the report has been made in one 
consistory, the sentence shall be deferred until another consistory, in order that the said 
inquiry may be more maturely looked into in the mean time,-unless the most blessed 
Pontiff shall judge it expedient to act otherwise. 
[Page 207] And the Synod ordains, that all and singular the particulars which have been 
elsewhere ordained, in the same Synod, touching the life, age, learning, and the other 
qualifications of those who are to be appointed bishops, the same are also to be required 
in the creation of cardinals-even though they be deacons -of the holy Roman Church; 
whom the most holy Roman Pontiff shall, as far as it can be conveniently done, select out 
of all the nations of Christendom, as he shall find persons suitable. 
Finally, the same holy Synod, moved by the so many most grievous afflictions of the 
Church, cannot avoid recording, that nothing is more necessary for the Church of God 
than that the most blessed Roman Pontiff apply especially here that solicitude, which, by 
the duty of his office, he owes to the Universal Church,-that he take unto himself, to wit 
as cardinals, persons the most select only, and that he appoint over each church, above all 
things, good and fit pastors; and this the more, for that our Lord Jesus Christ will require 
at his hands the blood of those sheep of Christ which shall perish through the evil 
government of pastors who are negligent, and forgetful of their office. 
CHAPTER II.  
A Provincial Synod to be celebrated every third year, a Diocesan Synod every year: who 
are to convoke, and who to be present thereat. 
Provincial councils, wheresoever they have been omitted, shall be renewed, for the 
regulating of morals, the correcting of excesses, the composing of controversies, and for 
the other purposes allowed of by the sacred canons. Therefore, the metropolitans in 
person, or if they be lawfully hindered, the oldest suffragan bishop shall not fail to 
assemble a Synod, each in his own province, within a year at latest from the termination 
of the present council, and afterwards, at least every third year, [Page 208] either after the 
octave of the Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, or at some other more convenient 
time, according to the custom of the province; at which council all the bishops and others, 
who, by right or custom, ought to be present thereat, shall be absolutely bound to 
assemble, those excepted who would have to cross the sea at their imminent peril. The 
bishops of the province shall not, for the future, be compelled, under the pretext of any 
custom whatsoever, to repair against their will to the metropolitan church. Those bishops 
likewise who are not subject to any archbishop, shall once for all make choice of some 
neighbouring metropolitan, at whose provincial Synod they shall be bound to be present 
with the other bishops, and shall observe, and cause to be observed, whatsoever shall be 
therein ordained. In all other respects, their exemption and privileges shall remain whole 
and entire. 
Diocesan Synods also shall be celebrated every year; to which all those even who are 
exempted, but who would otherwise, that exemption ceasing, have to attend, and who are 
not subject to general Chapters, shall be bound to come; understanding however that, on 
account of parochial, or other Secular churches, even though annexed, those who have 
charge thereof must needs, whosoever they may be, be present at the said Synod. But if 
any, whether metropolitans, or bishops, or the others above-named, shall be negligent in 
these matters, they shall incur the penalties enacted by the sacred canons. 
CHAPTER III.  
In what manner Prelates are to make their visitation. 
Patriarchs, primates, metropolitans, and bishops shall not fail to visit their respective 
dioceses, either personally, or, if they be lawfully hindered, by their Vicar-general, or 
visitor; if they shall not be able on account of its extent, to make the visitation of the 
whole annually, they shall visit at least the greater part thereof, so that the whole shall be 
completed in two years, [Page 209] either by themselves, or by their visitors. 
Metropolitans, however, even after having made a complete visitation of their own proper 
diocese, shall not visit the cathedral churches, or the dioceses of the bishops of their 
province, except for a cause taken cognizance and approved of in the provincial Council. 
But archdeacons, deans, and other inferiors, who have been hitherto accustomed lawfully 
to exercise (the power of) visitation in certain churches, shall henceforth visit those same 
places, but by themselves only, with the consent of the bishop, and assisted by a notary. 
The visitors also who may be deputed by a Chapter, where the Chapter has the right of 
visitation, shall be first approved of by the bishop; but the bishop, or, if he be hindered, 
his visitor, shall not thereby be prevented from visiting those same churches apart from 
those deputies; and the said archdeacons, and other inferiors, shall be bound to give the 
bishop an account, within a month, of the visitation that has been made, and to show him 
the depositions of witnesses, and the proceedings in their entire form; any custom, even 
though immemorial, and any exemptions and privileges whatsoever notwithstanding. 
But the principle object of all these visitations shall be to lead to sound and orthodox 
doctrine, by banishing heresies; to maintain good morals, and to correct such as are evil; 
to animate the people, by exhortations and admonitions, to religion, peacefulness, and 
innocence; and to establish such other things as to the prudence of the visitors shall seem 
for the profit of the faithful, according as time, place and opportunity shall allow. And to 
the end that all this may have a more easy and prosperous issue, all and each of the 
aforesaid, to whom the right of visitation belongs, are admonished to treat all persons with 
fatherly love and Christian zeal; and with this view being content with a modest train of 
servants and horses, they shall endeavour to complete the said visitation as speedily as 
possible, though with due carefulness. And during it they shall be careful not to be 
troublesome or burthensome to any one by any useless expenses; and neither they, nor 
any of theirs, shall, by way of agency fee for the visitation, or, on account of wills made 
for pious uses--except that which is of right due to them out of [Page 210] pious 
bequests--or under any other name whatsoever, receive anything, be it money, or present, 
of whatsoever kind, or in whatsoever way offered; any custom, even though immemorial, 
to the contrary notwithstanding; with the exception, however, of food, which shall be 
furnished frugally and in moderation to them and theirs, only during the time necessary 
for the visitation, and no longer. It shall, however, be at the option of those who are 
visited, to pay, if they prefer it, in money, according to a fixed assessment, what they have 
been accustomed heretofore to disburse, or to furnish the food as aforesaid; saving also 
the right of ancient conventions entered into with monasteries, or other pious places, or 
churches not parochial, which right shall remain inviolate. But, in those places or 
provinces, where it is the custom that neither food, money, nor anything else be received 
by the visitors, but that all be done gratuitously, the same shall be retained there. 
But if any one, which God forbid, shall presume to receive anything more than is 
prescribed in any of the cases above-named; besides the restitution of double the amount 
which is to be made within a month, he shall also be subjected, without any hope of 
pardon, to the other penalties contained in the constitution of the general Councils of 
Lyons, which begins, Exigit; as also to the other penalties (which shall be enacted) in the 
provincial Synod, at the discretion of that Synod. 
As regards patrons, they shall not presume in any way to interfere in those things which 
regard the administration of the sacraments; neither shall they meddle with the visitation 
of the ornaments of the church, or its revenues arising from landed property, or from 
buildings, excepting so far as they are competent to do this by the institution, or 
foundation; but the bishops themselves shall attend to these things, and shall take care that 
the revenues of those buildings be expended upon purposes necessary and useful for the 
church, as to them shall seem most expedient. 
[Page 211] 
CHAPTER IV.  
By whom, and when, the office of preaching is to be discharged: the Parish Church to be 
frequented in order to hear the word of God. No one shall preach in opposition to the will 
of the Bishop. 
The holy Synod, desirous that the office of preaching, which peculiarly belongs to 
bishops, may be exercised as frequently as possible, for the welfare of the faithful, and 
accommodating more aptly to the use of the present times, the canons elsewhere set forth 
on this subject, under Paul III., of happy memory, ordains, that the bishops shall 
themselves in person, each in his own church, announce the sacred Scriptures and the 
devine law, or if lawfully hindered, it shall be done by those whom they shall appoint to 
the office of preaching; and in the other churches by the parish priests, or, if they be 
hindered, by others to be deputed by the bishop, whether it be in the city, or in any other 
part whatsoever of the diocese wherein they shall judge such preaching expedient, at the 
charge of those who are bound, or who are accustomed, to defray it, and this at least on all 
Lord's Days and solemn festivals; but, during the season of the fasts, of Lent and of the 
Advent of the Lord, daily, or at least on three days in the week, if the said bishop shall 
deem it needful; and, at other times, as often as they shall judge that it can be opportunely 
done. And the bishop shall diligently admonish the people, that each one is bound to be 
present at his own parish church, where it can be conveniently done, to hear the word of 
God. But no one, whether Secular or Regular, shall presume to preach, even in churches 
of his own order, in opposition to the will of the bishop. 
The said bishops shall also take care, that, at least on the Lord's Days and other festivals, 
the children in every parish be carefully taught the rudiments of the faith, and obedience 
towards [Page 212] God and their parents, by those whose duty it is, and who shall be 
constrained thereunto by their bishops, if need be, even by ecclesiastical censures; any 
privileges and customs notwithstanding. In other respects, those things decreed, under the 
said Paul III., concerning the office of preaching, shall have their full force. 
CHAPTER V.  
In criminal causes against Bishops, the greater causes shall be taken cognizance of by the 
Sovereign Pontiff only, the less by the Provincial Council. 
The more grave criminal causes against bishops, even of heresy-which may God forfend
which merit deposition or deprivation, shall be taken cognizance of and decided by the 
Sovereign Roman Pontiff himself only. But if the cause shall be of such a nature that it 
must necessarily be committed out of the Roman Court, it shall not be committed to any 
others soever, but metropolitans, or bishops, to be chosen by the most blessed Pope. And 
this commission shall both be special, and shall be signed by the most holy Pontiff's own 
hand; nor shall he ever grant more to those commissioners than this,-that they take 
information only of the fact, and draw up the process, which they shall immediately 
transmit to the Roman Pontiff; the definitive sentence being reserved to the said most holy 
Pontiff. 
The other things hereupon elsewhere decreed, under Julius III., of happy memory, as also 
the constitution published in a general Council under Innocent III., which begins, Qualiter 
et quando, which constitution the holy Synod renews in this present decree, shall be 
observed by all. 
But the less criminal causes of bishops shall be taken cognizance of and decided in the 
provincial Council only, or by persons deputed thereunto by the provincial Council. 
[Page 213] 
CHAPTER VI.  
When and how the Bishop may absolve from crime, and dispense in cases of irregularity 
and suspension. 
It shall be lawful for the bishop to dispense in all manner of irregularities and 
suspensions, arising from a crime that is secret,-except that proceeding from wilful 
homicide, and those crimes which have been already carried before a legal tribunal; -and 
(it shall be lawful for them), in their own diocese, either by themselves, or by a vicar to be 
deputed especially for that purpose, to absolve gratuitously, as far as the tribunal of the 
conscience is concerned, after imposing a salutary penance, all delinquents whatsoever 
their subjects, in all cases whatsoever that are secret, even though reserved to the 
Apostolic See. The same also, as regards the crime of heresy, shall be permitted them in 
the said court of conscience, but to them only, and not to their vicars. 
CHAPTER VII.  
The virtue of the Sacraments shall, before being administered to the people, be explained 
by Bishops and Parish Priests; during the solemnization of mass, the sacred oracles shall 
be explained. 
In order that the faithful people may approach to the reception of the sacraments with 
greater reverence and devotion of mind, the holy Synod enjoins on all bishops, that, not 
only when they are themselves about to administer them to the people, they shall first 
explain, in a manner suited to the capacity of those who receive them, the efficacy and use 
of those sacraments, but shall endeavour that the same be done piously and prudently 
[Page 214] by every parish priest; and this even in the vernacular tongue, if need be, and 
it can be conveniently done; and in accordance with the form which will be prescribed for 
each of the sacraments, by the holy Synod, in a catechism which the bishops shall take 
care to have faithfully translated into the vulgar tongue, and to have expounded to the 
people by all parish priests; as also that, during the solemnization of mass, or the 
celebration of the divine offices, they explain, in the said vulgar tongue, on all festivals, 
or solemnities, the sacred oracles, and the maxims of salvation; and that, setting aside all 
unprofitable questions, they endeavour to impress them on the hearts of all, and to instruct 
them in the law of the Lord. 
CHAPTER VIII.  
On public sinners, a public penance shall be imposed, unless the Bishop shall determine 
otherwise: a Penitentiary to be instituted in Cathedral Churches. 
The apostle admonishes that those who sin publicly are to be reproved openly. When, 
therefore, any one has, publicly and in the sight of many, committed a crime, whereby 
there is no doubt that others have been offended and scandalized; there must needs be 
publicly imposed upon him a penance suitable to the measure of his guilt; that so those 
whom he has allured to evil manners by his example, he may bring back to an upright life 
by the testimony of his amendment. The bishop, however, may, when he judges it more 
expedient, commute this kind of public penance into one that is secret. Likewise, in all 
cathedral churches, where it can be conveniently done, the bishop shall appoint a 
penitentiary, annexing thereto the prebend that shall next become vacant, which 
penitentiary shall be a master, or doctor, or licentiate in theology, or in canon law, and 
forty years of age, or otherwise one who shall be found more suitable [Page 215] 
considering the character of the place; and, whilst hearing confessions in the church, he 
shall be meanwhile reputed as present in choir. 
CHAPTER IX.  
By whom Secular Churches, not of any diocese, are to be visited. 
Those things which have elsewhere been established by this same Council, under Paul 
III., of happy memory, and lately under our most blessed lord Pius IV., touching the 
diligence to be used by the Ordinaries in visiting benefices, even though exempted, the 
same shall also be observed in regard of those Secular churches which are said to be in no 
one's diocese; to wit they shall be visited by the bishop-as the delegate of the Apostolic 
See-whose cathedral church is the nearest, if he be able to do so; otherwise, by him whom 
the prelate of the said place has once for all selected in the provincial Council;-any 
privileges and customs whatsoever, even though immemorial, to the contrary 
notwithstanding. 
CHAPTER X.  
Where visitation and correction of morals are concerned, no suspension of decrees is 
allowed. 
Bishops, that they may be the better able to keep the people whom they rule in duty and 
obedience, shall, in all those things which regard visitation and correction of manners, 
have the right and power, even as delegates of the Apostolic See, of ordaining, regulating, 
correcting, and executing, in accordance with the enactments of the canons, those things 
which, in their prudence, shall seem to them necessary for the amendment of their 
subjects, and for the good of their respective dioceses. Nor herein, when visitation and 
correction of manners are concerned, shall any exemption, or any inhibition, or appeal, or 
complaint, even though interposed to the Apostolic See, in any way hinder, or suspend the 
execution of those things which shall have been by them enjoined, decreed, or adjudged. 
[Page 216] 
CHAPTER XI.  
Honorary titles, or particular privileges, shall not derogate in any way from the right of 
bishops. 
Forasmuch as the privileges and exemptions which, under various titles, are granted to 
very many persons, are clearly seen to raise, in these days, confusion in the jurisdiction of 
bishops, and to give occasion to those exempted to lead a more relaxed life; the holy 
Synod ordains, that if at any time it be thought proper, for just, weighty, and well nigh 
compulsory causes, that certain persons be distinguished by the honorary titles of 
Protonotary, Acolyte, Count Palatine, Royal Chaplain, or other such titles of distinction, 
whether in the Roman court or elsewhere; as also that others be admitted into monasteries 
as Oblates, or as attached thereunto in some other way, or under the name of servants to 
military orders, monasteries, hospitals, colleges, or under any other title whatsoever; 
nothing is to be understood as being, by these privileges, taken away from the Ordinaries, 
so as to prevent those persons, unto whom those privileges have already been granted, or 
to whom they may be hereafter conceded, from being fully subject in all things to the said 
Ordinaries, as delegates of the Apostolic See, and this as regards Royal Chaplains, in 
accordance with the constitution of Innocent III., which begins Cum capella: those 
persons, however, being excepted, who are engaged in actual service in the aforesaid 
places, or in military orders, and who reside within their enclosures and houses, and live 
under obedience to them; as also those who have made their profession lawfully and 
according to the rules of the said military orders, whereof the Ordinary must be certified: 
notwithstanding any privileges what soever, even those of the order of Saint John of 
Jerusalem, and of other military orders. But, as regards those privileges which by virtue of 
the constitution of Eugenius, those are accustomed to enjoy who reside in the Roman 
Court, or who are in the household of cardinals, such privileges shall in no wise be 
understood to apply to those who hold ecclesiastical benefices, in so [Page 217] far as 
those benefices are concerned; but such shall continue subject to the jurisdiction of the 
Ordinary; any inhibitions to the contrary notwithstanding. 
CHAPTER XII.  
What manner of persons those ought to be who are to be promoted to the dignities and 
canonries of Cathedral Churches: and what those so promoted are bound to perform. 
Whereas dignities, especially in cathedral churches, were established to preserve and 
increase ecclesiastical discipline, with the view that those who should obtain them, might 
be pre-eminent in piety, be an example to others, and aid the bishop by their exertions and 
services; it is but right, that those who are called unto those dignities, should be such as to 
be able to answer the purposes of their office. Wherefore, no one shall henceforth be 
promoted to any dignities whatsoever, to which the cure of souls is attached, who has not 
attained at least to the twenty-fifth year of his age, and, having been exercised for some 
time in the clerical order, is recommended by the learning necessary for the discharge of 
his office, and by integrity of morals, conformably to the constitution of Alexander III., 
promulgated in the Council of Lateran, which begins, Cum in cunctis. 
In like manner archdeacons, who are called the eyes of the bishop, shall, in all churches, 
where it is possible, be masters in theology, or doctors or licentiates in canon law. But, to 
the other dignities or personates, to which no cure of souls is attached, clerics shall be 
promoted, who are in other respects qualified, and who are not less than twenty-two years 
of age. Those also who are promoted to any benefices whatsoever having cure of souls, 
shall, within two months at the latest from the day of obtaining possession, be bound to 
make a public profession of their orthodox faith in the presence of the bishop [Page 218] 
himself, or, if he be hindered, before his Vicar-general, or official; and shall promise and 
swear, that they will continue in obedience to the Roman Church. But those who are 
promoted to canonries and dignities in cathedral churches, shall be bound to do this not 
only before the bishop, or his official, but also in the Chapter; otherwise all those 
promoted as aforesaid shall not render the fruits theirs; nor shall possession avail them 
anything. No one shall henceforth be received to a dignity, canonry, or portion, but one 
who has either already been admitted to that sacred order which that dignity, prebend, or 
portion requires, or is of such an age as to be capable of being admitted to that order, 
within the time prescribed by law and by this holy Synod. As regards all cathedral 
churches, all canonries and portions shall be attached to the order of the priesthood, 
deaconship, or subdeaconship; and the bishop, with the advice of the Chapter, shall 
designate and apportion, as he shall judge expedient, to which thereof each of those 
respective sacred orders is for the future to be annexed; in such wise, however, that one 
half at least shall be priests, and the rest deacons, or subdeacons: but where the more 
praiseworthy custom requires, that the greater part, or that all be priests, it shall be by all 
means retained. Moreover, the holy Synod exhorts that, in provinces where it can 
conveniently be done, all the dignities, and one half at least of the canonries, in cathedral 
and eminent collegiate churches, be conferred only on masters, or doctors, or even on 
licentiates in theology, or canon law. Furthermore, it shall not be lawful, by virtue of any 
manner of statute or custom whatsoever, for those who possess, in the said cathedral or 
collegiate churches, any dignities, canonries, prebends, or portions, to be absent from 
those churches, above three months in each year-saving, however, the constitutions of 
those churches which require a longer term of service-otherwise every offender shall, for 
the first year, be deprived of onehalf of the fruits which he has made his own by reason 
even of his prebend and residence. But, if he be again guilty of the same negligence, he 
shall be deprived of all the fruits which he may have acquired during that same year: and, 
the contumacy increasing, they shall be proceeded against according to the con-[Page 
219] stitutions of the sacred canons. As regards the distributions; those who have been 
present at the stated hours shall receive them; all others shall, all collusion and remission 
set aside, forfeit them, pursuant to the decree of Boniface VIII., which begins, 
Consuetudinem, which the holy Synod brings again into use; any statutes, or customs, 
whatsoever, to the contrary notwithstanding. And all shall be obliged to perform the 
divine offices in person, and not by substitutes; as also to attend on and serve the bishop 
when celebrating (mass), or performing any other pontifical functions; and reverently, 
distinctly, and devoutly to praise the name of God, in hymns and canticles, in the choir 
appointed for psalmody. 
They shall, moreover, at all times wear a becoming dress, both in and out of church; shall 
abstain from unlawful hunting, hawking, dancing, taverns, and gaines; and be 
distinguished for such integrity of manners, as that they may with justice be called the 
senate of the Church. As to other matters, regarding the suitable manner of conducting the 
divine offices, the proper way of singing or chanting therein, the specific regulations for 
assembling in choir and for remaining there, as also such things as may be necessary in 
regard of all those who minister in the church, and any other things of the like kind; the 
provincial Synod shall prescribe a fixed form on each Head, having regard to the utility 
and habits of each province. But, in the mean time, the bishop, assisted by not less than 
two canons, one of whom shall be chosen by the bishop, and the other by the Chapter, 
shall have power to provide herein as may be judged expedient. 
CHAPTER XIII.  
In what manner provision is to be made for the more slightly endowed Cathedral and 
Parish Churches: Parishes are to be distinguished by certain boundaries. 
Forasmuch as very many cathedral churches have so slight a revenue, and are so small, 
that they by no means correspond with the episcopal dignity, nor suffice for the 
necessities of the churches; the provincial Council, having summoned those whose [Page 
220] interests are concerned, shall examine and weigh with care, what churches it may be 
expedient, on account of their small extent, and their poverty, to unite to others in the 
neighbourhood, or to augment with fresh revenues; and shall send the documents 
prepared in regard thereof to the Sovereign Roman Pontiff; who, being thereby made 
acquainted with the matter, shall, of his own prudence, as he may judge expedient, either 
unite together the slightly provided churches, or improve them by some augmentation 
derived from the fruits. But in the meantime, until the things aforesaid are carried into 
effect, the Sovereign Pontiff may provide, out of certain benefices, for those bishops who, 
on account of the poverty of their dioceses, stand in need of being aided by certain fruits; 
provided however those benefices be not cures, nor dignities, canonries, prebends, nor 
monasteries wherein regular observance is in force, or which are subject to general 
Chapters, or to certain visitors. 
In parish churches also, the fruits of which are in like manner so slight that they are not 
sufficient to meet the necessary charges, the bishop,-if unable to provide for the exigency 
by a union of benefices, not however those belonging to Regulars,-shall make it his care, 
that, by the assignment of first fruits, or tithes, or by the contributions and collections of 
the parishioners, or in some other way that shall seem to him more suitable, as much be 
amassed as may decently suffice for the necessities of the rector and of the parish. 
But in whatsoever unions may have to be made, whether for the causes aforesaid, or for 
others, parish churches shall not be united to any monasteries whatever, or abbeys, or 
dignities, or prebends of a cathedral or collegiate church, or to any other simple benefices, 
hospitals, or military orders; and those so united shall be again taken cognizance of by the 
Ordinaries, pursuant to the decree already made in this same Synod, under Paul III., of 
happy memory, which shall also be equally observed in regard of those unions that have 
been made from that time forth to the present; notwithstanding whatsoever form of words 
may have been used therein, which shall be accounted as being sufficiently expressed 
here. 
Furthermore, all those cathedral churches, the revenue of which, [Page 221] in real annual 
value, does not exceed the sum of one thousand ducats, and those parish churches where 
it does not exceed the sum of one hundred ducats, shall not for the future be burthened 
with any manner of pensions, or reservations of fruits. Also, in those cities and places 
where the parish churches have not any certain boundaries, neither have the rectors 
thereof their own proper people to govern, but administer the sacraments to all 
indiscriminately who desire them, the holy Synod enjoins on bishops, that for the greater 
security of the salvation of the souls committed to their charge, having divided the people 
into fixed and proper parishes, they shall assign to each parish its own perpetual and 
peculiar parish priest who may know his own parishioners, and from whom alone they 
may licitly receive the sacraments; or the bishops shall make such other provision as may 
be more beneficial, according as the character of the place may require. They shall also 
take care, that the same be done, as soon as possible, in those cities and places where 
there are no parish churches: any privileges aind customs, even though immemorial, to 
the contrary notwithstanding. 
CHAPTER XIV.  
In promotions to benefices, or in admissions into possession of the same, any deductions 
from the fruits, not applied to pious uses, are prohibited. 
In many churches, as well cathedral as collegiate and parochial, it is understood to be the 
practice, derived either from the constitutions thereof, or from an evil custom, that upon 
any election, presentation, institution, confirmation, collation, or other provision, or upon 
admission to the possession of any cathedral church, benefice, canonries, or prebends, or 
to a participation in the revenues, or the daily distributions, there are introduced certain 
conditions, or deductions from the fruits, certain payments, promises, unlawful 
compensations, as also the profits which are in some churches called Turnorum lucra; and 
[Page 222] whereas the holy Synod detests these practices, It enjoins on bishops, that they 
suffer not anything of the kind to be done, unless the proceeds be converted to pious uses, 
nor permit any of those modes of entering (on benefices) which carry with them a 
suspicion of a simoniacal taint, or of sordid avarice; and they shall themselves carefully 
take cognizance of their constitutions, or customs in the above regards; and, those only 
being retained which they shall approve of as laudable, the rest they shall reject and 
abolish as corrupt and scandalous. And It decrees that those, who act in any way contrary 
to the things comprised in this present decree, incur the penalties set forth against 
simoniacs by the sacred canons, and divers constitutions of the Sovereign Pontiffs, all of 
which this Synod renews; any statutes, constitutions, customs, even though immemorial, 
even though confirmed by apostolic authority, to the contrary notwithstanding; the 
bishop, as the delegate of the Apostolic See, having power to take cognizance of any 
surreption, obreption, or defect of intention, in regard thereof. 
CHAPTER XV.  
Method of increasing the slight prebends of Cathedral, and of eminent Collegiate 
Churches. 
In cathedral, and eminent collegiate, churches, where the prebends are numerous, and so 
small, that, even with the daily distributions, they are not sufficient for the decent 
maintenance of the rank of the canons, according to the character of the place, and of the 
persons, it shall be lawful for the bishop, with the consent of the Chapter, either to unite 
thereunto certain simple benefices, not however such as belong to Regulars, or, if a 
provision cannot be made in this way, they may reduce those prebends to a less number, 
by suppressing some of them,-with the consent of the patron, if the right of patronage 
belong to laymen,-the fruits and proceeds of which shall be applied towards the daily 
distributions of the remaining prebends; yet so, however, that such a number shall be left 
as may conveniently serve for the celebration of divine worship, [Page 223] and be 
suitable to the dignity of the church; any constitutions and privileges whatsoever, or any 
reservation whether general or special, or any application whatever, to the contrary 
notwithstanding: nor shall the aforesaid unions or suppressions be set aside or hindered by 
any manner of provision whatsoever, not even by virtue of any resignation, or by any 
other derogations, or suspensions whatever. 
CHAPTER XVI.  
What duty devolves on the Chapter during the vacancy of a See. 
When a See is vacant, the Chapter, in those places where the duty of receiving the fruits 
devolves upon it, shall appoint one or more faithful and diligent stewards to take care of 
the property and revenues of the church, of which they shall afterwards give an account to 
him whom it may regard. It shall also be absolutely bound, within eight days after the 
decease of the bishop, to appoint an official, or vicar, or to confirm the one who fills that 
office; who shall at least be a doctor, or a licentiate, of canon law, or otherwise as 
competent a person as can be procured: if anything be done contrary hereto, the 
appointment aforesaid shall devolve on the metropolitan. And if the church be itself the 
metropolitan, or exempted, and the Chapter shall be, as has been said above, negligent, 
then shall the oldest of the suffragan bishops in that metropolitan church, and the nearest 
bishop in regard of that church that is exempted, have power to appoint a competent 
steward and vicar. And the bishop, who is promoted to the said vacant church, shall 
demand, from the said steward, vicar, and all other officers and administrators, who, 
during the vacancy of the See, were, by the Chapter, or others, appointed in his room,
even though they should belong to the Chapter itself,-an account of those things which 
concern him, of their functions, jurisdiction, administration, or of any other their charge 
whatsoever; and shall have [Page 224] power to punish those who have been guilty of 
any delinquency in their office or administration, even though the officers aforesaid, 
having given in their accounts, may have obtained a quittance or discharge from the 
Chapter, or those deputed thereby. The Chapter shall also be bound to render an account 
to the said bishop of any papers belonging to the church, if any such have come into the 
possession thereof. 
CHAPTER XVII.  
In what case it is lawful to confer more than one benefice upon one individual; and for 
him to retain the same. 
Whereas ecclesiastical order is perverted when one cleric fills the offices of several, the 
sacred canons have holily provided that no one ought to be enrolled in two churches. But, 
seeing that many, through the passion of ungodly covetousness deceiving themselves, not 
God, are not ashamed to elude, by various artifices, what has been so excellently 
ordained, and to hold several benefices at the same time; the holy Synod, desiring to 
restore the discipline required for the government of the church, doth by this present 
decree,-which It orders to be observed in regard of all persons whatsoever, by whatsoever 
title distinguished, even though it be by the dignity of the Cardinalate,-ordain, that, for the 
future, one ecclesiastical benefice only shall be conferred on one and the same person. If 
indeed that benefice be not sufficient to afford a decent livelihood to the person on whom 
it is conferred, it shall then be lawful to bestow on him some other simple benefice that 
may be sufficient; provided that both do not require personal residence. And the above 
shall apply not only to cathedral churches, but also to all other benefices whatsoever, 
whether Secular or Regular, even to those held in commendam, of whatsoever title and 
quality they may be. But they who at present hold several parochial churches, or one 
cathedral and one parochial church, shall be absolutely obliged,-all dispensations and 
unions for life whatsoever to the contrary notwithstanding,-retaining one parochial church 
only, or the cathedral church alone, to resign the other parochial [Page 225] churches 
within the space of six months; otherwise as well the parish churches, as also all the 
benefices which they hold, shall be accounted ipso jure void, and as void shall be freely 
conferred on other competent persons; nor shall they who previously held them be able to 
retain the fruits thereof, with a safe conscience, after the said time. But the holy Synod 
desires that a provision be made in some suitable manner, as may seem fit to the 
Sovereign Pontiff, for the necessities of those who resign. 
CHAPTER XVIII.  
Upon a Parish Church becoming vacant, a Vicar is to be deputed thereunto by the Bishop, 
until it be provided with a Parish Priest: in what manner and by whom those nominated to 
Parochial Churches ought to be examined. 
It is most highly expedient for the salvation of souls, that they be governed by worthy and 
competent parish priests. To the end that this may with greater care and effect be 
accomplished, the holy Synod ordains, that when a vacancy occurs in a parish church, 
whether by death, or by resignation, even in the Roman Court, or in any other manner 
whatsoever, though it may be alleged that the charge thereof devolves on the church 
(itself), or on the bishop, and though it may be served by one or more priests,-and this not 
excepting even those churches called patrimonial, or receptive, wherein the bishop has 
been accustomed to assign the cure of souls to one or more (priests), all of whom, as this 
Synod ordains, must be subjected to the examination herein prescribed later,-even though, 
moreover, the said parish church may be reserved, or appropriated, whether generally or 
specially, by virtue even of an indult, or privilege granted in favour of cardinals of the 
holy Roman Church, or of certain abbots, or chapters; it shall be the duty of the bishop, at 
once, upon obtaining information of the vacancy of the church, [Page 226] to appoint, if 
need be, a competent vicar to the same--with a suitable assignment, at his own discretion, 
of a portion of the fruits thereof--to support the duties of the said church, until it shall be 
provided with a rector. Moreover, the bishop, and he who has the right of patronage, shall, 
within ten days, or such other term as the bishop shall prescribe, nominate, in the presence 
of those who shall be deputed as examiners, certain clerics as capable of governing the 
said church. It shall nevertheless be free for others also, who may know any that are fit for 
the office, to give in their names, that a diligent scrutiny may be afterwards made as to the 
age, morals, and sufficiency of each. And even,--if the bishop, or the provincial Synod 
shall, considering the custom of the country, judge this more expedient,--those who may 
wish to be examined may be summoned by a public notice. When the time appointed has 
transpired, all those whose names have been entered shall be examined by the bishop, or, 
if he be hindered, by his Vicar-general, and by the other examiners, who shall not be 
fewer than three; to whose votes, if they should be equal, or given to distinct individuals, 
the bishop, or his vicar, may add theirs, in favour of whomsoever they shall think most fit. 
And as regards the examiners, six at least shall be annually proposed by the bishop, or by 
his vicar, in the diocesan Synod; who shall be such as shall satisfy, and shall be approved 
of by, the said Synod. And upon any vacancy occurring in any church, the bishop shall 
select three out of that number to make the examination with him; and afterwards, upon 
another vacancy following, he shall select, out of the six aforesaid, the same, or three 
others, whom he may prefer. But the said examiners shall be masters, or doctors, or 
licentiates in theology, or in canon law, or such other clerics, whether Regulars,-even of 
the order of mendicants,-or Seculars, as shall seem best adapted thereunto; and they shall 
all swear on the holy Gospels of God, that they will, setting aside every human affection, 
faithfully perform their duty. And they shall beware of receiving anything whatever, 
either before or after, on account of this examination; otherwise, both the receivers and 
the givers will incur the guilt of simony, from which they shall not be capable of [Page 
227] being absolved, until after they have resigned the benefices which they were 
possessed of in any manner whatsoever, even before this act; and they shall be rendered 
incapable of any others for the time to come. And in regard of all these matters, they shall 
be bound to render an account, not only to God, but also, if need be, to the provincial 
Synod, which shall have power to punish them severely, at Its discretion, if it be 
ascertained that they have done anything contrary to their duty. 
Then, after the examination is completed, a report shall be made of all those who shall 
have been judged, by the said examiners, fit by age, morals, learning, prudence, and other 
suitable qualifications, to govern the vacant church; and out of these the bishop shall 
select him whom he shall judge the most fit of all; and to him, and to none other, shall the 
church be collated by him unto whom it belongs to collate thereunto. But, if the church be 
under ecclesiastical patronage, and the institution thereunto belongs to the bishop, and to 
none else, whomsoever the patron shall judge the most worthy from amongst those who 
have been approved of by the examiners, him he shall be bound to present to the bishop, 
that he may receive institution from him: but when the institution is to proceed from any 
other than the bishop, then the bishop alone shall select the worthiest from amongst the 
worthy, and him the patron shall present to him unto whom the institution belongs. 
But if it be under lay patronage, the individual who shall be presented by the patron, must 
be examined, as above, by those deputed thereunto, and not be admitted, unless he be 
found fit. And, in all the above-mentioned cases, to none other but to one of those who 
have been examined as aforesaid, and have been approved of by the examiners, according 
to the rule prescribed above, shall the church be committed, nor shall any devolution, or 
appeal, interposed even before the Apostolic See, or the legates, vice-legates, or nuncios 
of that see, or before any bishops, or metropolitans, primates, or patriarchs, hinder or 
suspend the report of the aforesaid examiners from being carried into execution: for the 
rest, the vicar whom the bishop has, at his own discretion, already deputed for the time 
being to the vacant church, or whom he may afterwards happen to depute [Page 228] 
thereunto, shall not be removed from the charge and administration of the said church, 
until it be provided for, either by the appointment of the vicar himself, or of some other 
person, who has been approved of and elected as above: and all provisions and 
institutions made otherwise than according to the above-named form, shall be accounted 
surreptitious: any exemptions, indults, privileges, preventions, appropriations, new 
provisions, indults granted to any university whatsoever, even for a certain sum, and any 
other impediments whatsoever, in opposition to this decree, notwithstanding. 
If, however, the said parish churches should possess so slight a revenue, as not to allow of 
the trouble of all this examination; or should no one seek to undergo this examination; or 
if, by reason of the open factions, or dissensions, which are met with in some places, more 
grievous quarrels and tumults may easily be excited thereby; the Ordinary may, omitting 
this formality, have recourse to a private examination, if, in his conscience, with the 
advice of the (examiners) deputed, he shall judge this expedient; observing however the 
other things as prescribed above. It shall also be lawful for the provincial Synod, if It shall 
judge that there are any particulars which ought to be added to, or retrenched from, the 
above regulations concerning the form of examination, to provide accordingly. 
CHAPTER XIX.  
Mandates 'de providendo,' Expectatives, and other things of the like kind are abrogated. 
The holy Synod ordains, that mandates for contingent promotions, and those graces which 
are called expectant, shall not any more be granted to any one, not even to colleges, 
universities, senates, or to any individuals whatsoever, even [Page 220] though under the 
name of an indult, or up to a certain sum, or under any other colourable title; nor shall it 
be lawful for any one to make use of such as have been heretofore granted. So, neither 
shall any mental reservations, nor any other graces whatsoever in regard of future 
vacancies in benefices, nor indults which apply to churches belonging to others, or to 
monasteries, be granted to any, not even cardinals of the holy Roman Church; and those 
hitherto granted shall be looked upon as abrogated. 
CHAPTER XX.  
The manner of conducting causes, appertaining to the Ecclesiastical court, is prescribed. 
All causes belonging in any way whatever to the ecclesiastical court, even though they 
may relate to benefices, shall be taken cognizance of, in the first instance, before the 
Ordinaries of the places only; and shall be completely terminated within two years at the 
latest from the time that the suit was instituted: otherwise, at the expiration of that period, 
it shall be free for the parties, or for either of them, to have recourse to superior, but 
otherwise competent, judges, who shall take up the cause as it shall then stand, and shall 
take care that it be terminated with all possible despatch; nor, before that period, shall the 
causes be committed to any others (than the Ordinaries), nor be transferred therefrom; nor 
shall any appeals interposed by those parties be received by any superior judges 
whatsoever; nor shall any commission, or inhibition be issued by them, except upon a 
definitive sentence, or one that has the force thereof, and the grievance arising from which 
cannot be redressed by an appeal from that definitive sentence. From the above are to be 
excepted those causes, which, pursuant to the appointments of the canons, are to be tried 
before the Apostolic See, or those which the Sovereign Roman Pontiff shall, for an urgent 
and [Page 221] reasonable cause, judge fit to appoint, or to avocate, for his own hearing, 
by a special rescript under the signature of his Holiness signed with his own hand. 
Furthermore, matrimonial and criminal causes shall not be left to the judgment of deans, 
archdeacons, and other inferiors, even when on their course of visitation, but shall be 
reserved for the examination and jurisdiction of the bishop only; even though there should 
be, at this present moment, a suit pending, in whatsoever stage of the proceedings it may 
be, between any bishop, and the dean, or archdeacon, touching the cognizance of this 
class of causes: and if, in any said matrimonial cause, one of the parties shall truly prove 
his property in the presence of the bishop, he shall not be compelled to plead out of the 
province, either in the second or third stage of the suit, unless the other party will provide 
for his maintenance, and also bear the expenses of the suit. 
Legates also, even though de latere, nuncios, ecclesiastical governors, or others, shall not 
only not presume, by virtue of any powers whatsoever, to impede bishops in the causes 
aforesaid, or in any wise to take from them, or to disturb their jurisdiction, but they shall 
not even proceed against clerics, or other ecclesiastical persons, until the bishop has been 
first applied to, and has shown himself negligent; otherwise their proceedings and 
ordinances shall be of no force, and they shall be bound to make satisfaction to the parties 
for the damages which they have sustained. 
Furthermore, should any individual appeal in those cases allowed of by law, or lodge a 
complaint touching any grievance, or have recourse, as aforesaid, to a judge, on account 
of two years having elapsed, he shall be bound to transfer, at his own expense, to the 
judge of appeal, all the acts of the proceedings that have taken place before the bishop, 
having given, however, notice thereof previously to the said bishop; that so, if it seem fit 
to him to communicate any information on the suit, he may acquaint the judge of appeal 
therewith. But if the appellee [Page 231] shall appear, then shall he also be bound to bear 
his proportion of the costs of transferring those acts, provided that he wishes to make use 
thereof; unless it be the custom of the place to act otherwise, to wit, that the entire costs 
have to be borne by the appellant. 
Moreover, the notary shall be bound to furnish the appellant, upon payment of the suitable 
fee, with a copy of the proceedings as soon as may be, and within a month at the furthest. 
And should that notary be guilty of any fraud in delaying the giving such copy, he shall be 
suspended from the exercise of his office, at the discretion of the Ordinary, and be 
condemned to pay double the costs of the suit, which shall be divided between the 
appellant and the poor of the place. But if the judge also should himself be cognizant of, 
and an accomplice in, this delay, or if he shall in any other way raise obstacles against the 
entire proceedings being delivered over to the appellant within the term aforesaid, he shall 
be subjected to the same penalty of paying double the costs, as above; notwithstanding, as 
regards all the aforesaid matters, any privileges, indults, covenants, which only bind the 
authors thereof, and any other customs whatsoever to the contrary. 
CHAPTER XXI.  
It is declared, that, by certain words used previously, the usual manner of treating 
business in General Councils is not changed. 
The holy Synod,-being desirous that no occasion of doubting may, at any future period, 
arise out of the decrees which It has published,-in explanation of the words contained in a 
decree published in the first Session under our most blessed lord, Pius IV., to wit, "which, 
the legates and presidents proposing, shall to the said holy Synod appear suitable and 
proper for assuaging the calamities of these times, terminating the controversies 
concerning religion, restraining deceitful tongues, correcting the abuses of depraved 
manners, and procuring for the church a true and Christian peace," declares that it was not 
Its [Page 232] intention, that, by the foregoing words, the usual manner of treating 
matters in general Councils should be in any respect changed; or that anything new, 
besides that which has been heretofore established by the sacred canons, or by the form of 
general Councils, should be added to, or taken from, any one. 
INDICTION OF THE NEXT SESSION.
 Moreover, the same sacred and holy Synod ordains and decrees, that the next ensuing 
Session be held on the Thursday after the Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which 
will be the ninth day of December next, with the power also of abridging that term. In 
which Session there will be treated of the sixth chapter which is now deferred till then, 
and the remaining chapters on Reformation which have been already set forth, and other 
matters which relate thereunto. And if it shall seem advisable, and the time will allow 
thereof, certain dogmas may also be treated of, as in their proper season they shall be 
proposed in the congregations. 
The term fixed for the Session was abridged.

SESSION THE TWENTY-FIFTH, 
Begun on the third, and terminated on the fourth, day of December, MDLXIII., being the 
ninth and last under the Sovereign Pontiff, Pius IV. 
DECREE CONCERNING PURGATORY.
 Whereas the Catholic Church, instructed by the Holy Ghost, has, from the sacred writings 
and the ancient tradition of the Fathers, taught, in sacred councils, and very recently in 
this oecumenical Synod, that there is a Purgatory, and that the souls there detained are 
helped by the suffrages of the faithful, [Page 233] but principally by the acceptable 
sacrifice of the altar; the holy Synod enjoins on bishops that they diligently endeavour 
that the sound doctrine concerning Purgatory, transmitted by the holy Fathers and sacred 
councils, be believed, maintained, taught, and every where proclaimed by the faithful of 
Christ. But let the more difficult and subtle questions, and which tend not to edification, 
and from which for the most part there is no increase of piety, be excluded from popular 
discourses before the uneducated multitude. In like manner, such things as are uncertain, 
or which labour under an appearance of error, let them not allow to be made public and 
treated of. While those things which tend to a certain kind of curiosity or superstition, or 
which savour of filthy lucre, let them prohibit as scandals and stumbling-blocks of the 
faithful. But let the bishops take care, that the suffrages of the faithful who are living, to 
wit the sacrifices of masses, prayers, alms, and other works of piety, which have been 
wont to be performed by the faithful for the other faithful departed, be piously and 
devoutly performed, in accordance with the institutes of the church; and that whatsoever 
is due on their behalf, from the endowments of testators, or in other way, be discharged, 
not in a perfunctory manner, but diligently and accurately, by the priests and ministers of 
the church, and others who are bound to render this (service). 
ON THE INVOCATION, VENERATION, AND RELICS, OF SAlNTS, AND ON 
SACRED IMAGES.
The holy Synod enjoins on all bishops, and others who sustain the office and charge of 
teaching, that, agreeably to the usage of the Catholic and Apostolic Church, received from 
the primitive times of the Christian religion, and agreeably to the consent of the holy 
Fathers, and to the decrees of sacred Councils, they especially instruct the faithful 
diligently concerning the intercession and invocation of saints; the honour (paid) to [Page 
234] relics; and the legitimate use of images: teaching them, that the saints, who reign 
together with Christ, offer up their own prayers to God for men; that it is good and useful 
suppliantly to invoke them, and to have recourse to their prayers, aid, (and) help for 
obtaining benefits from God, through His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who is our alone 
Redeemer and Saviour; but that they think impiously, who deny that the saints, who enjoy 
eternal happiness in heaven, are to be invocated; or who assert either that they do not pray 
for men; or, that the invocation of them to pray for each of us even in particular, is 
idolatry; or, that it is repugnant to the word of God; and is opposed to the honour of the 
one mediator of God and men, Christ Jesus; or, that it is foolish to supplicate, vocally, or 
mentally, those who reign in heaven. Also, that the holy bodies of holy martyrs, and of 
others now living with Christ,-which bodies were the living members of Christ, and the 
temple of the Holy Ghost, and which are by Him to be raised unto eternal life, and to be 
glorified,--are to be venerated by the faithful; through which (bodies) many benefits are 
bestowed by God on men; so that they who affirm that veneration and honour are not due 
to the relics of saints; or, that these, and other sacred monuments, are uselessly honoured 
by the faithful; and that the places dedicated to the memories of the saints are in vain 
visited with the view of obtaining their aid; are wholly to be condemned, as the Church 
has already long since condemned, and now also condemns them. 
Moreover, that the images of Christ, of the Virgin Mother of God, and of the other saints, 
are to be had and retained particularly in temples, and that due honour and veneration are 
to be given them; not that any divinity, or virtue, is believed to be in them, on account of 
which they are to be worshipped; or that anything is to be asked of them; or, that trust is 
to be reposed in images, as was of old done by the Gentiles who placed [Page 235] their 
hope in idols; but because the honour which is shown them is referred to the prototypes 
which those images represent; in such wise that by the images which we kiss, and before 
which we uncover the head, and prostrate ourselves, we adore Christ; and we venerate the 
saints, whose similitude they bear: as, by the decrees of Councils, and especially of the 
second Synod of Nicaea, has been defined against the opponents of images. 
And the bishops shall carefully teach this,-that, by means of the histories of the mysteries 
of our Redemption, portrayed by paintings or other representations, the people is 
instructed, and confirmed in (the habit of) remembering, and continually revolving in 
mind the articles of faith; as also that great profit is derived from all sacred images, not 
only because the people are thereby admonished of the benefits and gifts bestowed upon 
them by Christ, but also because the miracles which God has performed by means of the 
saints, and their salutary examples, are set before the eyes of the faithful; that so they may 
give God thanks for those things; may order their own lives and manners in imitation of 
the saints; and may be excited to adore and love God, and to cultivate piety. But if any 
one shall teach, or entertain sentiments, contrary to these decrees; let him be anathema. 
And if any abuses have crept in amongst these holy and salutary observances, the holy 
Synod ardently desires that they be utterly abolished; in such wise that no images, 
(suggestive) of false doctrine, and furnishing occasion of dangerous error to the 
uneducated, be set up. And if at times, when expedient for the unlettered people; it happen 
that the facts and narratives of sacred Scripture are portrayed and represented; the people 
shall be taught, that not thereby is the Divinity represented, as though it could be seen by 
the eyes of the body, or be portrayed by colours or figures. 
Moreover, in the invocation of saints, the veneration of relics, and the sacred use of 
images, every superstition shall be removed, all filthy lucre be abolished; finally, all 
lasciviousness be [Page 236] avoided; in such wise that figures shall not be painted or 
adorned with a beauty exciting to lust; nor the celebration of the saints, and the visitation 
of relics be by any perverted into revellings and drunkenness; as if festivals are celebrated 
to the honour of the saints by luxury and wantonness. 
In fine, let so great care and diligence be used herein by bishops, as that there be nothing 
seen that is disorderly, or that is unbecomingly or confusedly arranged, nothing that is 
profane, nothing indecorous, seeing that holiness becometh the house of God. 
And that these things may be the more faithfully observed, the holy Synod ordains, that 
no one be allowed to place, or cause to be placed, any unusual image, in any place, or 
church, howsoever exempted, except that image have been approved of by the bishop: 
also, that no new miracles are to be acknowledged, or new relics recognised, unless the 
said bishop has taken cognizance and approved thereof; who, as soon as he has obtained 
some certain information in regard to these matters, shall, after having taken the advice of 
theologians, and of other pious men, act therein as he shall judge to be consonant with 
truth and piety. But if any doubtful, or difficult abuse has to be extirpated; or, in fine, if 
any more grave question shall arise touching these matters, the bishop, before deciding 
the controversy, shall await the sentence of the metropolitan and of the bishops of the 
province, in a provincial Council; yet so, that nothing new, or that previously has not been 
usual in the Church, shall be resolved on, without having first consulted the most holy 
Roman Pontiff. 
ON REGULARS AND NUNS
 The same sacred and holy Synod, prosecuting the subject of reformation, has thought fit 
that the things following be ordained. 
[Page 237] 
CHAPTER I.  
All ReguIars shall order their lives in accordance with what is prescribed by the rule 
which they have professed; Superiors shall sedulously provide that this be done. 
Forasmuch as the holy Synod is not ignorant how much splendour and utility accrue to 
the Church of God, from monasteries piously instituted and rightly administered; It has,-
to the end that the ancient and regular discipline may be the more easily and promptly 
restored, where it has fallen away, and may be the more firmly maintained, where it has 
been preserved,--thought it necessary to enjoin, as by this decree It doth enjoin, that all 
Regulars, as well men, as women, shall order and regulate their lives in accordance with 
the requirements of the rule which they have professed; and above all that they shall 
faithfully observe whatsoever belongs to the perfection of their profession, such as the 
vows of obedience, poverty, and chastity, as also all other vows and precepts that may be 
peculiar to any rule or order, respectively appertaining to the essential character of each, 
and which regard the observance of a common mode of living, food, and dress. And all 
care and diligence shall be used by the Superiors, both in the general and in the provincial 
Chapters, and in their visitations, which they shall not omit to make in their proper 
seasons, that these things be not departed from; it being certain, that those things which 
belong to the substance of a regular life cannot be by them relaxed. For if those things 
which are the basis and the foundation of all regular discipline be not strictly preserved, 
the whole edifice must needs fall. 
CHAPTER II.  
Property is wholly prohibited to Regulars. 
For no Regular, therefore, whether man, or woman, shall it be lawful to possess, or hold 
as his own, or even in the name of [Page 238] the convent, any property moveable or 
immoveable, of what nature soever it may be, or in what way soever acquired; but the 
same shall be immediately delivered up to the Superior, and be incorporated with the 
convent. Nor shall it henceforth be lawful for Superiors to allow any real property to any 
Regular, not even by way of having the interest, or the use, the administration thereof, or 
in commendam. But the administration of the property of monasteries, or of convents, 
shall belong to the officers thereof only, removable at the will of their Superiors. 
The Superiors shall allow the use of moveables, in such manner as that the furniture of 
their body shall be suitable to the state of poverty which they have professed; and there 
shall be nothing therein superfluous, but at the same time nothing shall be refused which 
is necessary for them. But should any one be discovered, or be proved, to possess 
anything in any other manner, he shall be deprived during two years of his active and 
passive voice, and also be punished in accordance with the constitutions of his own rule 
and order. 
CHAPTER III.  
All Monasteries save those herein excepted, shall be able to possess real property: the 
number of persons therein to be determined by the amount of Income, or of Alms. No 
Monasteries, to be erected without the Bishop's leave. 
The holy Synod permits that henceforth real property may be possessed by all 
monasteries and houses, both of men and women, and of mendicants, even by those who 
were forbidden by their constitutions to possess it, or who had not received permission to 
that effect by apostolic privilege,-with the exception, however, of the houses of the 
brethren of St. Francis (called) Capuchins, and those called Minor Observants: and if any 
of the aforesaid places, to which it has been granted by apostolic [Page 239] authority to 
possess such property, have been stripped thereof, It ordains that the same shall be wholly 
restored unto them. But, in the aforesaid monasteries amid houses, as well of men as of 
women, whether they possess, or do not possess, real property, such a number of inmates 
only shall be fixed upon and be for the future retained, as can be conveniently supported, 
either out of the proper revenues of those monasteries, or out of the customary alms; nor 
shall any such places be henceforth erected, without the permission of the bishop, in 
whose diocese they are to be erected, being first obtained. 
CHAPTER IV.  
A Regular shall not, without the permission of his Superior, either place himself at the 
service of another, or retire from his Monastery: when sent to a University for study he 
shall reside in a Monastery. 
The holy Synod forbids, that any Regular, under the pretext of preaching, or lecturing, or 
of any other pious work, place himself at the service of any prelate, prince, university, 
community, or of any other person, or place, whatsoever, without permission from his 
own Superior; nor shall any privilege or faculty, obtained from others in regard hereof 
avail him anything. But should any one act contrary hereto, he shall be punished as 
disobedient, at the discretion of his Superior. Nor shall it be lawful for Regulars to 
withdraw from their own convents, even under the pretext of repairing to their own 
Superiors; unless they have been sent, or summoned, by them. And whoever shall be 
found to be without the order aforesaid in writing, shall be punished as a deserter from his 
Institute by the Ordinaries of the places. As to those who are sent to the universities for 
the sake of their studies, they shall dwell in convents only; otherwise they shall be 
proceeded against by the Ordinaries. 
[Page 240] 
CHAPTER V.  
Provision is made for the enclosure and safety of Nuns. 
The holy Synod, renewing the constitution of Boniface VIII., which begins Periculoso, 
enjoins on all bishops, by the judgment of God to which It appeals, and under pain of 
eternal malediction, that, by their ordinary authority, in all monasteries subject to them, 
and in others, by the authority of the Apostolic See, they make it their especial care, that 
the enclosure of nuns be carefully restored, wheresoever it has been violated, and that it 
be preserved, wheresoever it has not been violated; repressing, by ecclesiastical censures 
and other penalties, without regarding any appeal whatsoever, the disobedient and 
gainsayers, and calling in for this end, if need be, the aid of the Secular arm. The holy 
Synod exhorts Christian princes to furnish this aid, and enjoins, under pain of 
excommunication, to be ipso facto incurred, that it be rendered by all civil magistrates. 
But for no nun, after her profession, shall it be lawful to go out of her convent, even for a 
brief period, under any pretext whatever, except for some lawful cause, which is to be 
approved of by the bishop; any indults and privileges whatsoever notwithstanding. 
And it shall not be lawful for any one, of whatsoever birth, or condition, sex, or age, to 
enter within the enclosure of a nunnery, without the permission of the bishop, or of the 
Superior, obtained in writing, under the pain of excommunication to be ipso facto 
incurred. But the bishop, or the Superior ought to grant this permission in necessary cases 
only; nor shall any other person be able by any means to grant it, even by virtue of any 
faculty, or indult, already granted, or that may hereafter be granted. And forasmuch as 
those convents of nuns which are established outside the walls of a city or town, are 
exposed, often without any protection, to the robberies and other crimes of wicked men, 
the bishops and other Superiors shall, if they think it expedient, make it their care that the 
nuns be removed from those places to new or old convents within cities or popu-[Page 
241]lous towns, calling in even, if need be, the aid of the Secular arm. As to those who 
hinder them or disobey, they shall by ecclesiastical censures compel them to submit. 
CHAPTER VI.  
Manner of choosing Regular Superiors.
 In order that everything may be conducted uprightly and without fraud, in the election of 
all manner of superiors, temporary abbots, and other officers, and generals, and abbesses, 
and other superioresses, the holy Synod above all things strictly enjoins, that all the 
aforesaid ought to be chosen by secret voting, in such wise as that the names of the 
respective voters shall never be made known. Neither shall it, for the future, be lawful to 
appoint provincials, abbots, priors, or any other titularies whatsoever, for the purposes of 
an election that is to take place; nor to supply the place of the voices and suffrages of 
those who are absent. But should any one be elected contrary to the appointment of this 
decree, such election shall be invalid; and he who shall have allowed himself, for this 
object, to be created provincial, abbot, or prior, shall be from that time forth incapable of 
holding any offices whatsoever in that order; and any faculties that have been granted in 
this matter shall be looked upon as hereby abrogated; and should any others be granted 
for the time to come, they shall be regarded as surreptitious. 
CHAPTER VII.  
In what way, and what manner of, persons are to be chosen as Abbesses, or Superioresses 
by whatsoever other name; no one shall be appointed over two Nunneries. 
No one shall be elected as abbess, or prioress,--or by whatsoever other name she who is 
appointed and placed over the [Page 242] rest, may be called,--who is less than forty 
years of age, and who has not passed eight of those years in a praiseworthy manner, after 
having made her profession. But should no one be found in the same convent with these 
qualifications, one may be elected out of another convent of the same order. But if the 
superior who presides over the election shall deem even this an inconvenience; with the 
consent of the bishop, or other superior, there may be one chosen from amongst those, in 
the same convent, who are beyond their thirtieth year, and who have, since their 
profession, passed at least five of those years in an upright manner. But no individual 
shall be set over two convents; and if any one is, in any way, in possession of two or 
more, she shall, retaining one, be compelled to resign the rest, within six months: but after 
that period, if she have not resigned, they shall be all ipso jure vacant. And he who 
presides at the election, whether it be the bishop, or other superior, shall not enter the 
enclosure of the monastery, but shall listen to, or receive the votes of each, at the little 
window in the gates. In other particulars, the constitution of each order, or convent, shall 
be observed. 
CHAPTER VIII.  
In what manner the regulation of Monasteries, which have not ordinary Regular visitors, 
is to be proceeded with. 
All monasteries which are not subject to general Chapters, or to bishops, and which have 
not their own ordinary Regular visitors, but have been accustomed to be governed under 
the immediate protection and direction of the Apostolic See, shall be bound, within a year 
from the end of the present Council, and thenceforth every third year, to form themselves 
into congregations, according to the form of the constitution of Innocent III., beginning In 
singulis, published in a general Council; [Page 243] and shall there depute certain 
Regulars to deliberate and ordain as to the mode and order of establishing the 
congregations aforesaid, and touching the statutes to be therein observed. But should they 
be negligent in these matters, it shall be lawful for the metropolitan, in whose province 
the aforesaid monasteries are situated, to convoke them for the above named purposes, as 
the delegate of the Apostolic See. But if there be not a sufficient number of monasteries, 
within the limits of one province, for the establishing of such congregation, the 
monasteries of two or three provinces may form one congregation. And when the said 
congregations have been established, the general Chapters thereof, and the presidents and 
visitors elected thereby, shall have the same authority over the monasteries of their own 
congregation, and over the Regulars dwelling therein, as other presidents and visitors 
have in other orders; and they shall be bound to visit frequently the monasteries of their 
own congregation, and to apply themselves to the reformation thereof; and to observe 
whatsoever things have been decreed in the sacred canons, and in this sacred Council. 
Also, if, at the instance of the metropolitan, they shall not take measures to execute the 
above, they shall be subjected to the bishops, in whose dioceses the places aforesaid are 
situated, as the delegates of the Apostolic See. 
CHAPTER IX.  
Convents of Nuns immediately subject to the Apostolic See shall be governed by the 
Bishops; but others, by those deputed in the General Chapters, or by other Regulars. 
Those convents of nuns which are immediately subject to the Apostolic See, even those 
which are called by the name of Chapters of St. Peter, or of St. John, or by whatsoever 
other name they may be designated, shall be governed by the bishops, as the delegates of 
the Apostolic See; anything to the contrary notwithstanding. But those which are 
governed, by persons deputed in general Chapters, or by other Regulars, shall be left 
under their care and conduct. 
[Page 244] 
CHAPTER X.  
Nuns shall confess and communicate once a month; an extraordinary Confessor shall be 
assigned them by the Bishop. The Eucharist shall not be reserved within the enclosure of 
the Convent. 
Bishops and other Superiors of convents of nuns, shall take particular care that the nuns 
be admonished, in their constitutions, to confess their sins, and to receive the most holy 
Eucharist, at least once a month, that so they may fortify themselves, by that salutary 
safeguard, resolutely to overcome all the assaults of the devil. But besides the ordinary 
confessor, the bishop and other superiors shall, twice or thrice a year, offer them an 
extraordinary one, whose duty it shall be to hear the confessions of all the nuns. But that 
the most holy body of Christ be kept within the choir, or the enclosure of the convent, and 
not in the public church, the holy Synod forbids it; any privilege or indult whatsoever 
notwithstanding. 
CHAPTER XI.  
In Monasteries, which are charged with the cure of the souls of laymen, they who exercise 
that cure shall be subject to the Bishop, and be by him previously examined, with certain 
exceptions. 
In monasteries, or houses whether of men, or of women, which are charged with the cure 
of souls of other Secular persons besides those who belong to the household of those 
monasteries, or places; the individuals, whether Regulars or Seculars, who exercise that 
cure, shall be immediately subject, in what-[Page 245]soever pertains to the said cure and 
the administration of the sacraments, to the jurisdiction, visitation, and correction of the 
bishop in whose diocese those places are situated; nor shall any, not even such as are 
removable at pleasure, be deputed thereunto, save with the consent of the said bishop, and 
after having been previously examined by him, or by his vicar; the monastery of Cluny 
with its limits being excepted; and excepting also monasteries, or places, in which abbots, 
generals, or the heads of orders, have their usual principal residence; as also the other 
monasteries, or houses, in which the abbots, or other Superiors or Regulars, exercise 
episcopal and temporary jurisdiction over the parish priests and their parishioners; saving, 
however, the right of those bishops who exercise a greater jurisdiction over the places, or 
persons above-named. 
CHAPTER XII.  
Episcopal censures, and festivals appointed in the diocese, shall be observed even by 
Regulars. 
Censures and interdicts,-not only those emanating from the Apostolic See, but also those 
promulgated by the Ordinaries,-shall, upon the bishop's mandate, be published and 
observed by Regulars in their churches. The festival days also which the said bishop shall 
order to be observed in his own diocese, shall be kept by all exempted persons, even 
though Regulars. 
CHAPTER XIII.  
The Bishop shall settle disputes about precedency. Exempted persons, not living in the 
more strict enclosures, are obliged to attend at public Processions. 
All disputes about precedence, which very often, with very great scandal, arise between 
ecclesiastics, both Secular and Regular, as well at public processions, as at those which 
take [Page 246] place in burying the dead, or carrying the canopy, and on other such 
occasions, the bishop shall settle, without regarding any appeal; anything to the contrary 
notwithstanding. And all exempted persons whatsoever, as well Secular as Regular 
clerics, and even monks, on being summoned to public processions, shall be obliged to 
attend; those only being excepted who always live in more strict enclosure. 
CHAPTER XIV.  
By whom punishment is to be inflicted on a Regular who sins publicly. 
A Regular who, not being subject to the bishop, and residing within the enclosure of a 
monastery, has out of that enclosure, transgressed so notoriously as to be a scandal to the 
people, shall, at the instance of the bishop, be severely punished by his own Superior, 
within such time as the bishop shall appoint; and the Superior shall certify to the bishop 
that the punishment has been inflicted: otherwise he shall be himself deprived of his 
office by his own Superior, and the delinquent may be punished by the bishop. 
CHAPTER XV.  
Profession shall not be made except after a year 's probation, and at the age of sixteen 
years completed. 
In no religious order whatever, shall the profession, whether of men or women, be made 
before the age of sixteen years is completed; nor shall any one be admitted to profession, 
who has been less than a year under probation from the time of taking the habit. And any 
profession made sooner than this shall be null; and shall not superinduce any obligation to 
the observance of any rule, or of any religious body, or order; or entail any other effects 
whatsoever. 
[Page 247] 
CHAPTER XVI.  
Any renunciation made, or obligation entered into, previous to the two months' nearest 
Profession, shall be null. The probation ended, the Novices shall either be professed, or 
dismissed. In the Religious order of Clerks of the Society of Jesus nothing is innovated. 
No part of the property of a Novice shall be given to a Monastery before Profession.
 Further, no renunciation made, or obligation entered into, sooner than this, even though 
upon oath, or in favour of any pious object whatsoever, shall be valid, unless it be made 
with permission of the bishop, or of his vicar, within the two months immediately 
preceding profession; and it shall not otherwise be understood as obtaining effect, unless 
the profession have followed thereupon: but if made in any other manner, even though 
with the express renunciation, even upon oath, of this privilege, it shall be invalid and of 
no effect. When the period of the noviciate is ended, the Superiors shall admit those 
novices, whom they have found qualified, to profession; or they shall dismiss them from 
the monastery. 
By these things, however, the Synod does not intend to make any innovation, or 
prohibition, so as to hinder the Religious Order of Clerks of the Society of Jesus from 
being able to serve God and His church, in accordance with their pious institute, approved 
of by the holy Apostolic See. 
Also, before the profession of a novice, whether male, or female, nothing shall be given to 
the monastery out of the property of the same, either by parents, relatives, or guardians 
under any pretext whatever, except for food and clothing, for [Page 248] the time that 
they are under probation; lest the said novice may be unable to leave on this account,--that 
the monastery is in possession of the whole, or of the greater part of his substance; and he 
may not easily be able to recover it, if he should leave. Yea rather the holy Synod enjoins, 
under the pain of anathema on the givers and receivers, that this be nowise done; and that, 
to those who leave before their profession, every thing that was theirs be restored to them. 
And the bishop shall, if need be, enforce by ecclesiastical censures that this be performed 
in a proper manner. 
CHAPTER XVII.  
If a girl, who is more than twelve years of age, wish to take the Regular Habit, she shall 
be questioned by the Ordinary, and again before Profession. 
The holy Synod, having in view the freedom of the profession on the part of virgins who 
are to be dedicated to God, ordains and decrees, that if a girl, being more than twelve 
years of age, desire to take the religious habit, she shall not take that habit, neither shall 
she, nor any other, at a later period, make her profession, until the bishop,--or, if he be 
absent, or hindered, his vicar, or some one deputed thereunto by them, and at their 
expense,--has carefully examined into the inclination of the virgin, whether she has been 
compelled or enticed thereunto, or knows what she is doing; and if her will be found to be 
pious and free, and she have the qualifications required by the rule of that convent and 
order; and if also the convent be a suitable one; it shall be free for her to make her 
profession. And that the bishop may not be in ignorance as to the time of profession, the 
Superioress of the convent shall be bound to give him notice thereof a month beforehand ; 
but if she do not acquaint him therewith, she shall be suspended from her office, for as 
long a period as the bishop shall think fit. 
[Page 249] 
CHAPTER XVIII.  
No one shall, except in the cases by law expressed, compel a woman to enter a 
Monastery; or prevent her, if she desire to enter. The constitutions of the Penitents, or 
Convertites, shall all be preserved. 
The holy Synod places under anathema all and singular those persons, of what quality or 
condition soever they may be, whether clerics or laymen, Seculars or Regulars, or with 
whatsoever dignity invested, who shall, in any way whatever, force any virgin, or widow, 
or any other woman whatsoever,--except in the cases provided for by law,--to enter a 
convent against her will, or to take the habit of any religious order, or to make her 
profession; as also all those who lend their counsel, aid, or countenance thereunto ; and 
those also who, knowing that she does not enter into the convent voluntarily, or 
voluntarily take the habit, or make her profession, shall, in any way, interfere in that act, 
by their presence, or consent, or authority. 
It also subjects to a like anathema those who shall, in any way, without a just cause, 
hinder the holy wish of virgins, or other women, to take the veil, or make their vows. And 
all and singular those things which ought to be done before profession, or at the 
profession itself, shall be observed not only in convents subject to the bishop, but also in 
all others whatsoever. From the above, however, are excepted those women who are 
called penitents, or convertites; in whose regard their constitutions shall be observed. 
CHAPTER XIX.  
How to proceed in cases of pretended invalidity of profession.
 No Regular soever, who shall pretend that he entered into a religious order through 
compulsion and fear ; or shall even allege [Page 250] that he made his profession before 
the proper age; or the like; and would fain lay aside his habit, be the cause what it may; or 
would even withdraw with his habit without the permission of his superior; shall be 
listened to, unless it be within five years only from the day of his profession, and not then 
either, unless he has produced before his own superior, and the Ordinary, the reasons 
which he alleges. But if, before doing this, he has of his own accord laid aside his habit; 
he shall in no wise be admitted to allege any cause whatever; but shall be compelled to 
return to his monastery, and be punished as an apostate; and meanwhile he shall not have 
the benefit of any privilege of his order. 
Also, no Regular shall, by virtue of any manner of faculty, be transferred to an order less 
rigid; nor shall permission be granted to any Regular to wear in secret the habit of his 
order. 
CHAPTER XX.  
Superiors of orders not subject to bishops shall visit and correct inferior Monasteries, 
even though held in commendam. 
Abbots, who are heads of orders, and the other Superiors of the aforesaid orders, who are 
not subject to bishops, but have a lawful jurisdiction over other inferior monasteries, or 
priories, shall, each in his own place and order, visit officially the said monasteries and 
priories that are subject to them, even though held in commendam: which, for as much as 
they are subject to the heads of their own orders, the holy Synod declares that they are not 
to be included in what has been elsewhere decreed relative to the visitation of monasteries 
held in commendam ; and those who preside over monasteries of the orders aforesaid 
shall be bound to receive the above-named visitors, and to execute their orders. 
Also, those monasteries themselves which are the heads of orders, shall be visited 
conformably to the constitutions of the holy Apostolic See, and of each several order. And 
so long as the said commendatary monasteries shall continue, there shall be appointed, by 
the general Chapters, or by the visitors of the [Page 251] said orders, priors claustral, or 
sub-prior in those priories that are conventual, who shall exercise spiritual authority, and 
correction. In all other things the privileges and faculties of the above-named orders, as 
regards the persons, places, and rights thereof, shall remain firm and inviolate. 
CHAPTER XXI.  
Over Monasteries, Religious of that same order shall be appointed. 
Whereas very many monasteries, even abbeys, priories, and provostries, have suffered no 
slight injury, both in spirituals and temporals, through the mal-administration of those to 
whom they have been entrusted, the holy Synod would fain by every means restore them 
to a discipline suitable to a monastic life. But the present state of the times is so fraught 
with hindrances and difficulties that a remedy can neither be applied at once to all, nor 
common to all places, as It could desire; nevertheless, that It may not omit anything 
which may in time be used in wholesomely providing against the evils aforesaid, It trusts 
in the first place, that the most holy Roman Pontiff will, of his piety and prudence, make 
it his care,-as far as he sees that the times will permit,--that over those monasteries which 
are at present held in commendam, and which are conventual, there be appointed 
Regulars, expressly professed of the same order, and capable of guiding and of governing 
the flock. And as to such as shall become vacant hereafter, they shall be conferred solely 
on Regulars of distinguished virtue and holiness. But as regards those monasteries which 
are the heads and chiefs of orders, be the filiations thereof called abbeys or priories, those 
who hold them at present in commendam shall be bound,-unless provision be made for a 
Regular successor thereunto,--[Page 252] either to make, within six months, a solemn 
profession of the religious life which is peculiar to the said orders, or to resign; otherwise 
the places aforesaid held in commendam shall be accounted ipso jure vacant. But, lest any 
fraud may be used as regards all and singular the aforesaid matters, the holy Synod 
ordains, that in the appointments to the said monasteries, the quality of each individual be 
specifically expressed; and any appointment made otherwise shall be accounted 
surreptitious, and shall not be rendered valid by any subsequent possession, even though 
extending over three years. 
CHAPTER XXII.  
The Decrees touching the Reformation of Regulars shall be carried into execution at once 
by all.
 The holy Synod enjoins, that all and singular the matters contained in the foregoing 
decrees be observed in all convents and monasteries, colleges, and houses of all monks 
and religious whatsoever, as also of all religious virgins and widows soever, even though 
living under the conduct of the military orders, of the order even (of St. John) of 
Jerusalem, and by what name soever they may be designated, under whatsoever rule or 
constitutions they may be, or under the care or government of, or in subjection to, union 
with, or dependence on, any order whatsoever, whether of mendicants, or not mendicants, 
or of other Regular monks, or canons of whatsoever kind : any privileges whatsoever of 
all and each of the above-named, under whatsoever form of words expressed, even those 
called mare magnum, even those obtained at their foundation, as also any constitutions 
and rules whatsoever, even though sworn to, and any customs, or prescriptions 
whatsoever, even though immemorial, to the contrary notwithstanding. But, if there be 
any Regulars, whether men or women, who are living under stricter rule or statutes, the 
holy Synod does not intend to withdraw them from their institute and observance, except 
as to the power of possessing real property in common. And forasmuch as the holy [Page 
253] Synod desires that all and singular the things aforesaid be put in execution as soon as 
possible, It enjoins on all bishops that, in the monasteries which are subject to them, as 
also in all the rest specially committed to them in the preceding decrees; and on all 
abbots, and generals, and other Superiors of the above-named orders ; that they forthwith 
put in execution the matters aforesaid, and if there be anything which is not carried into 
execution, the provincial Councils shall remedy, and punish the negligence of the 
bishops ; and that of Regulars, their provincial and general Chapters ; and, in default of 
general Chapters, the provincial Councils shall, by deputing certain persons belonging to 
the same order, provide herein. 
The holy Synod also exhorts all kings, princes, republics, and magistrates, and by virtue 
of holy obedience commands them, to vouchsafe to interpose, as often as requested, their 
help and authority in support of the aforesaid bishops, abbots, generals, and other 
superiors in the execution of the things comprised above, that so they may, without any 
hindrance, rightly execute the preceding matters to the praise of Almighty God. 
DECREE ON REFORMATION.
 CHAPTER I.  
Cardinals and all Prelates of the churches shall be content with modest furniture and a 
frugal table: they shall not enrich their relatives or domestics out of the property of the 
Church. 
It is to be wished, that those who undertake the office of a bishop should understand what 
their portion is; and comprehend that they are called, not to their own convenience, not to 
riches or luxury, but to labours and cares for the glory of God. For it is not to be doubted, 
that the rest of the faithful [Page 254] also will be more easily excited to religion and 
innocence, if they shall see those who are set over them, not fixing their thoughts on the 
things of this world, but on the salvation of souls, and on their heavenly country. 
Wherefore the holy Synod, being minded that these things are of the greatest importance 
towards restoring ecclesiastical discipline, admonishes all bishops, that, often meditating 
thereon, they show themselves conformable to their office, by their actual deeds, and the 
actions of their lives; which is a kind of perpetual sermon; but above all that they so order 
their whole conversation, as that others may thence be able to derive examples of 
frugality, modesty, continency, and of that holy humility which so much recom mends us 
to God. 
Wherefore, after the example of our fathers in the Council of Carthage, It not only orders 
that bishops be content with modest furniture, and a frugal table and diet, but that they 
also give heed that in the rest of their manner of living, and in their whole house, there be 
nothing seen that is alien from this holy institution, and which does not manifest 
simplicity, zeal towards God, and a contempt of vanities. Also, It wholly forbids them to 
strive to enrich their own kindred or domestics out of the revenues of the church: seeing 
that even the canons of the Apostles forbid them to give to their kindred the property of 
the church, which belongs to God; but if their kindred be poor, let them distribute to them 
thereof as poor, but not misapply, or waste, it for their sakes : yea, the holy Synod, with 
the utmost earnestness, admonishes them completely to lay aside all this human and 
carnal affection towards brothers, nephews and kindred, which is the seed-plot of many 
evils in the church. And what has been said of bishops, the same is not only to be 
observed by all who hold ecclesiastical benefices, whether Secular or Regular, each 
according to the nature of his rank, but the Synod decrees that it also regards the cardinals 
of the holy Roman Church ; for whereas, upon their advice to the most holy Roman 
Pontiff, the administration of the universal Church depends, it would seem to be a shame, 
if they did not at the same time shine so pre-eminent in virtue and in the discipline of their 
lives, as deservedly to draw upon themselves the eyes of all men. 
[Page 255] 
CHAPTER II.  
By whom individually the Decrees of the Council are to be solemnly received; and by 
whom a profession of faith is to be made. 
The calamitousness of the times, and the malignity of the increasing heresies demand, that 
nothing be left undone which may seem in any wise capable of tending to the edification 
of the people, and to the defence of the Catholic faith. Wherefore the holy Synod enjoins 
on patriarchs, primates, archbishops, bishops, and all others, who, of right or custom, 
ought to be present at the provincial Council, that, in the very first provincial Synod that 
shall be held after the close of this Council, they publicly receive all and singular the 
things that have been defined and ordained by this holy Synod; as also that they promise 
and profess true obedience to the Sovereign Roman Pontiff; and at the same time publicly 
express their detestation of and anathematize all the heresies that have been condemned 
by the sacred canons and general councils, and especially by this same Synod. And 
henceforth, all those who shall be promoted to be patriarchs, primates, archbishops, and 
bishops, shall strictly observe the same in the first provincial Synod at which they shall be 
present. And should any one of all the aforesaid refuse, which God forbid, the bishops of 
the same province shall be bound, under pain of the divine indignation, at once to give 
notice thereof to the Sovereign Roman Pontiff, and shall meanwhile abstain from 
communion with that person. And all others, who now hold, or shall hereafter hold, 
ecclesiastical benefices, and whose duty it is to be present at the diocesan Synod, shall do 
and observe the same, as above set down, on the very first occasion that the synod shall 
be held, otherwise they shall be punished according to the form of the sacred canons. 
Moreover, all those to whom belong the charge, visitation, and reformation of universities 
and of (places of) general studies, shall diligently take care that the canons and decrees of 
this holy Synod be, by the said universities, wholly [Page 256] received; and that the 
masters, doctors, and others, in the said universities, interpret and teach those things 
which are of Catholic faith, in conformity therewith; and that at the beginning of each 
year they bind themselves by solemn oath to this procedure. And also if there be any other 
things that need correction and reformation in the universities aforesaid, they shall be 
reformed and regulated by those whom it regards, for the advancement of religion and of 
ecclesiastical discipline. But as regards those universities which are immediately under 
the protection of the Sovereign Pontiff, and are subject to his visitation, his Blessedness 
will take care that they be, by his delegates, wholesomely visited and reformed in the 
manner aforesaid, and as shall seem to him most advantageous. 
CHAPTER III.  
The sword of excommunication is not to be rashly used: when an execution can be made 
on property or person, censures are to be abstained from: the civil magistrates shall not 
interfere herein. 
Although the sword of excommunication is the very sinews of ecclesiastical discipline, 
and very salutary for keeping the people in their duty, yet it is to be used with sobriety 
and great circumspection; seeing that experience teaches, that if it be rashly or for slight 
causes wielded, it is more despised than feared, and produces ruin rather than safety. 
Wherefore, those excommunications, which, after certain admonitions, are wont to be 
issued with the view as it is termed, of causing a revelation, or on account of things that 
have been lost or stolen, shall be issued by no one whomsoever, but the bishop; and not 
then, otherwise than on account of some circumstance of no common kind which moves 
the mind of the bishop thereunto, after the cause has been by him diligently and very 
maturely weighed ; nor shall he be induced to grant the said excommunications by the 
authority of any Secular person whatever, even though a magistrate; but the whole shall 
be left to his own judgment and [Page 257] conscience, when, considering the 
circumstances, the place, the person, or the time, he shall himself judge that such are to be 
resolved on. 
As regards judicial causes, it is enjoined on all ecclesiastical judges, of whatsoever 
dignity they may be, that, both during the proceedings, and in giving judgment, they 
abstain from ecclesiastical censures, or interdict, as often as an execution on the person or 
property can, in each stage of the process, be effected by them of their own proper 
authority ; but in civil causes, which in any way belong to the ecclesiastical court, it shall 
be lawful for them, if they judge it expedient, to proceed against all persons whatsoever, 
even laymen, and to terminate suits, by means of pecuniary fines, which, by the very fact 
of being levied, shall be assigned to the pious places there existing; or by distress upon 
the goods, or arrest of the person, to be made either by their own, or other officers; or 
even by deprivation of benefices, and other remedies at law. But if the execution cannot 
be made in this way, either upon the person, or goods, of the guilty, and there be 
contumacy towards the judge, he may then, in addition to the other penalties, smite them 
also with the sword of anathema, if he think fit. 
In like manner in criminal causes, wherein an execution can as above be effected upon the 
person or goods, the judge shall abstain from censures ; but, if that execution cannot 
easily be made, it shall be lawful for the judge to employ the said spiritual sword against 
delinquents ; provided however the character of the offence so require, and after two 
monitions at least, and this by public notice. And it shall not be lawful for any civil 
magistrate, to prohibit an ecclesiastical judge from excommunicating any individual; or to 
command that he revoke an excomnunication that has been issued; under pretext that the 
things contained in the present decree have not been observed; whereas the cognizance 
hereof does not appertain to Seculars, but to ecclesiastics. And every excommunicated 
person, who, after the lawful monitions, does not repent, shall not only not be received to 
the sacraments, and to communion, and [Page 258] intercourse with the faithful, but, if, 
being bound with censures, he shall, with obdurate heart, remain for a year in the 
defilement thereof, he may even be proceeded against as suspected of heresy. 
CHAPTER IV.  
Where the number of Masses to be celebrated is excessive, Bishops, Abbots, and 
Generals, shall make such regulation as shall seem to them expedient. 
It frequently happens, in divers churches, either that so great a number of masses is 
required to be celebrated on account of various legacies from persons deceased, that it is 
not possible to comply therewith on the particular days prescribed by the testators; or, that 
the alms left for the celebration thereof is so slight that it is not easy to find any one 
willing to undertake the duty; whereby the pious intentions of the testators are frustrated, 
and occasion is given for burthening the consciences of those who are concerned in the 
aforesaid obligations. The holy Synod, being desirous that these legacies for pious uses be 
satisfied in the most complete and useful manner possible, empowers bishops in diocesan 
Synod, and likewise abbots and generals of orders in their general Chapters, to ordain, in 
regard hereof, whatsoever in their consciences they shall, upon a diligent examination of 
the circumstances, judge to be most expedient for God's honour and worship, and the 
good of the churches, in those churches aforesaid which they shall find stand in need of 
some regulation in this matter, in such wise however that a commemoration be always 
made of the departed who, for the welfare of their souls, have left the said legacies for 
pious uses. 
[Page 259] 
CHAPTER V.  
The conditions and obligations imposed on Benefices shall be observed. 
Reason requires, that, in regulations which have been well established, no alteration be 
made by any ordinances to the contrary. Whenever, therefore, by virtue of the erection or 
foundation of any benefices, or in consequence of other regulations, certain qualifications 
are required, or certain obligations are attached thereunto, they shall not be derogated 
from in the collation, or in any other arrangement whatsoever in regard of the said 
benefices. The same also shall be observed as to prebends assigned to teachers of 
theology, masters, doctors, priests, deacons, or subdeacons, whenever such prebends have 
been established in this manner, in such sort that, in no provision whatever shall anything 
be altered in regard of the said qualifications and orders ; and any provision made 
otherwise shall be accounted surreptitious. 
CHAPTER VI.  
In what manner the Bishop ought to act in regard of the visitation of exempted Chapters. 
The holy Synod ordains that the decree, made under Paul III., of happy memory, 
beginning Capitula Cathedralium, shall be observed in all cathedral and collegiate 
churches, not only when the bishop makes his visitation, but also as often as he proceeds 
ex officio, or at the petition of another, against any one of those who are comprised in the 
said decree; yet so, however, that whenever he institutes proceedings out of visitation, all 
the particulars subjoined shall have place: to wit, that the Chapter shall, at the beginning 
of each year, select two individuals belong-[Page 260]ing to the Chapter, with whose 
counsel and consent the bishop, or his vicar, shall be bound to proceed, both in instituting 
the process, and in all the other acts thereof until the end of the cause inclusively,-in the 
presence, nevertheless, of the notary of the said bishop, and in the bishop's house, or his 
ordinary court of justice. The two deputies shall, however, have but one vote ; but either 
of them may give his vote in unison with that of the bishop. But if, as regards any 
proceeding, or as regards any interlocutory or definitive sentence, they shall both differ 
from the bishop, they shall in this case choose, in conjunction with the bishop, a third 
person, within the term of six days: and should they also not agree in the election of that 
third person, the choice shall devolve on the nearest bishop ; and the point whereon they 
differed shall be decided, in accordance with the opinion which that third person sides 
with; otherwise, the proceedings, and what follows thereupon, shall be null, and of no 
effect in law. Nevertheless, in crimes arising from incontinency, whereof mention has 
been made in the decree concerning concubinaries, as also in the more heinous crimes 
which require deposition or degradation; where flight is apprehended, and where, that 
judgment may not be eluded, it is necessary to secure the person, the bishop may at first 
proceed singly to a summary information, and to the necessary detention of the person; 
observing, however, in the rest of the proceedings, the order named above. But in all 
cases regard is to be paid to this, that the delinquents be kept in custody in a suitable 
place, according to the quality of the crime and of the persons. Moreover, there shall 
everywhere be rendered to bishops that honour which comports with their dignity; and in 
choir, in the chapter, in processions, and other public functions, they shall have the first 
seat, and the place which they shall themselves make choice of, and theirs shall be the 
chief authority in everything that is to be done. 
If the bishops shall propose anything to the canons to be deliberated on, and the matter 
treated of be not one which [Page 261] regards any benefit to them or theirs, they shall 
themselves convoke the Chapter, take the votes, and decide according to them. But, in the 
absence of the bishop, this shall be wholly done by those of the Chapter, to whom of right 
or custom it appertains, nor shall the bishop's vicar be allowed to do it. But in all other 
things, the jurisdiction and power of the Chapter, if any there be belonging thereunto, as 
also the administration of their property, shall be left wholly unimpaired and untouched. 
As regards those who do not possess any dignities, and are not of the Chapter, they shall 
all be subject to the bishop in causes ecclesiastical; notwithstanding, as regards the things 
aforesaid, any privileges accruing even from any foundation; as also any customs, even 
though immemorial; any sentences, oaths, concordates, which bind the authors thereof 
only; saving, however, in all things those privileges which have been granted to 
universities for general studies, or to the persons who belong thereunto. But all and 
singular these things shall not have effect in those churches wherein the bishops, or their 
vicars, by virtue of constitutions, privileges, customs, concordates, or by any other right 
whatsoever, have a power, authority, and jurisdiction greater than that which is included 
in the present decree; from which (powers) the holy Synod does not intend to derogate. 
CHAPTER VII.  
The Access and Regress in regard of Benefices are done away with ; in what manner, to 
whom, and for what cause, a Coadjutor is to be granted. 
Whereas, as regards ecclesiastical benefices, whatsoever carries with it the appearance of 
hereditary succession is a thing odious to the sacred constitutions, and contrary to the 
decrees of the Fathers; no Access or Regress, in regard of any ecclesiastical benefice of 
whatsoever quality, shall, even though by con-[Page 262]sent, be henceforth granted to 
any individual; nor shall those already granted be suspended, extended, or transferred. 
And this decree shall have effect in regard of all ecclesiastical benefices whatsoever, and 
even in cathedral churches, and as regards all manner of persons soever, even though 
distinguished with the honour of the cardinalate. 
In like manner, as regards coadjutorships with future succession, the same shall 
henceforth be observed; (to wit) that they shall not be permitted to any one in regard of 
any ecclesiastical benefices whatsoever. But if at any time the urgent necessity, or the 
evident advantage of a cathedral church, or of a monastery, demands that a coajutor be 
granted to a prelate, such coadjutor with (the right of) future succession shall not 
otherwise be granted but after the said cause has been first diligently taken cognizance of 
by the most holy Roman Pontiff; and it is certain, that all those qualifications which, by 
law, and by the decrees of this holy Synod, are required in bishops and prelates, are 
reunited in his person; otherwise, the concessions made herein, shall be accounted 
surreptitious. 
CHAPTER VIII.  
What is to be observed in regard to Hospitals. By whom, and in what manner, the 
negligence of administrators is to be punished. 
The holy Synod admonishes all who hold any ecclesiastical benefices, whether Secular or 
Regular, to accustom themselves, as far as their revenues will allow, to exercise with 
alacrity and kindliness the office of hospitality, so frequently commended by the holy 
Fathers; being mindful that those who cherish hospitality receive Christ in (the person of) 
their guests. But as regards those who hold in commendam, or by way of administration, 
or under any other title whatsoever, or have even united to their own churches, the places 
commonly called hospitals, or other pious places instituted especially for the use of 
pilgrims, of the infirm, the aged or the poor; or, if the parish churches should happen to be 
united to hospitals, or have been turned [Page 263] into hospitals, and have been granted 
to the patrons thereof to be by them administered, the Synod strictly commands, that they 
execute the charge and duty imposed upon them, and that they actually exercise that 
hospitality, which is due at their hands, out of the fruits devoted to that purpose, pursuant 
to the constitution of the Council of Vienne, renewed elsewhere by this same holy Synod 
under Paul III., of happy memory, and which begins, Quia contingit. But if these hospitals 
were instituted to receive a certain class of pilgrims, or of infirm persons, or of others; and 
in the place where the said hospitals are situated, there are no such persons, or very few, 
to be found, It doth further command, that the fruits thereof be converted to some other 
pious use, the nearest that may be to their original destination, and the most useful for that 
time and place, as shall seem to be the most expedient to the Ordinary, aided by two of 
the Chapter, experienced in matters of business, to be chosen by him; unless it be that the 
contrary happen to be expressed, to meet even this case, in the foundation, or institution 
thereof; in which event, the bishop shall take care that what is ordained be observed, or, if 
that be not possible, he shall, as above, regulate the matter in a useful manner. 
Wherefore, if all and singular the persons aforesaid, of whatsoever order, and religious 
body, and dignity they may be, be they even laymen, who have the administration of 
hospitals,--provided, however, they be not subject to Regulars where regular observance 
is in force,--shall, after having been admonished be the Ordinary, have ceased really to 
discharge the duty of hospitality, complying with all the necessary conditions to which 
they are bound, they may be compelled thereunto not only by ecclesiastical censures, and 
other remedies at law, but may also even be deprived for ever of the administration and 
care of the hospital itself; and others shall be substituted in their place, by those to whom 
this may belong. And the persons aforesaid shall, this notwithstanding, be bound in 
conscience to make restitution of the fruits which they have received contrary to the 
institution of the said hospitals; which restitution shall not be pardoned them by any 
remission or composition: nor shall the administration or government of such places be 
henceforth en-[Page 264]trusted to one and the same person longer than for three years, 
unless it be otherwise provided in the foundation thereof; notwithstanding, as regards all 
the above-named particulars, any union, exemption, and custom, even from time 
immemorial, to the contrary, or any privileges, or indults of whatever kind. 
CHAPTER IX.  
In what manner a right of patronage is to be proved, and to whom granted: what is not 
lawful for patrons. Unions of free benefices, to churches under right of patronage, 
prohibited. Rights of patronage, not legitimately obtained, are to be revoked. 
Even as it is not just to take away the legitimate rights of patronage, and to violate the 
pious intentions of the faithful in the institution thereof, so also neither is it to be suffered, 
that, under this pretext, ecclesiastical benefices be reduced to a state of servitude, as by 
many is impudently done. In order, therefore, that what reason requires may be observed 
in all things, the holy Synod ordains, that the title to the right of patronage shall be 
(derived) from a foundation, or an endowment ; which (title) shall be shown from an 
authentic document, and the other (proofs) required by law; or, also, by repeated 
presentations during a period of time so remote that it exceeds the memory of man; or, 
otherwise, according as the law directs. But as regards those persons, or communities, or 
universities, which that right is for the most part presumed to have been obtained by 
usurpation rather than otherwise, a more full and exact proof shall be required to establish 
a true title; nor shall the proof derived from time immemorial be otherwise of avail in 
their regard, unless-besides other things necessary for that proof--presentations, even 
continuous, during the space of not less than fifty years, at the least, all of which 
presentations have been carried into effect, shall be proved from authentic writings. All 
other rights of patronage, in regard to benefices, as well Secular as Regular, or parochial, 
or in regard of dignities, or any other benefices whatsoever, in a cathedral or col-[Page 
265]legiate church; as also all faculties and privileges, whether granted so as to have the 
force of patronage, or, by virtue of any other right whatsoever, to nominate, elect, present 
to the said benefices when they become vacant, excepting the rights of patronage belong 
to cathedral churches, and excepting such other (rights of patronage) as belong to the 
emperor, to kings. or to those who possess kingdoms, and to other high and supreme 
princes who have the rights of sovereignty within their own dominions, as also those 
(rights of patronage) which have been bestowed in favour of (places of) general studies, 
shall be understood to wholly abrogated and made void, together with the quasi
possession which has followed thereupon. And benefices of this kind shall be conferred, 
as being free, by those who collate thereunto; and such appointment shall have full effect. 
Furthermore, it shall be lawful for the bishop to reject the persons whom the patrons have 
presented, if they be not fit. But if the institution belong to inferior (ecclesiastics), they 
(the presentees) shall nevertheless be examined by the bishop, pursuant to what has been 
elsewhere ordained by this holy Synod; otherwise the institution made by those inferiors 
shall be null and void. 
But the patrons of benefices, of whatsoever order and dignity they may be, be they (the 
patrons) even communities, universities, or any colleges whatsoever whether of clerics or 
laymen, shall not in any way, nor for any manner of cause or occasion, meddle with the 
receiving of the fruits, rents, or revenues of any benefices whatsoever, even though those 
benefices be truly, by foundation or endowment, under their right of patronage; but shall 
leave them to the free disposal of the rector, or of the beneficiary, any custom whatever to 
the contrary notwithstanding. Nor shall they presume to transfer to others, contrary to the 
decrees of the canons, the said right of patronage, by sale, or under any other title 
whatsoever: if they act otherwise, they shall be subjected to the penalties of 
excommunication and interdict, and shall be ipso jure deprived of the aforesaid right itself 
of patronage. Moreover, those accessions made [Page 266] by way of union of free 
benefices with churches that are subject to the right of patronage, even of laymen, 
whether those churches be parochial, or benefices of any other kind whatsoever, even 
such as are simple, or are dignities, or hospitals, in such wise that the free benefices 
aforesaid are made to be of the same nature as those unto which they are united, and are 
placed under the (same) right of patronage; such (accessions), if they have not as yet been 
carried into full effect, as also such as shall henceforth be made, at the instance of any 
person whatsoever, by whatsoever authority, be it even apostolic, shall, together with the 
said unions themselves, be regarded as having been obtained surreptitiously; 
notwithstanding any form of words therein employed, or any derogation which may be 
held as equivalent to being expressed; nor shall such unions be any more carried into 
execution, but the benefices themselves so united shall, when vacant, be freely conferred 
as previously. 
As regards those augmentations, which, having been made within the last forty years, 
have obtained their effect and a complete incorporation; such shall nevertheless be 
reviewed and examined by the Ordinaries, as the delegates of the Apostolic See; and 
those which shall be found to have been obtained by surreption, or obreption, shall, 
together with the unions, be declared invalid, and the benefices themselves shall be 
separated, and be conferred upon other persons. 
In like manner also whatsoever rights of patronage,-over churches, and any other 
benefices of whatsoever kind, even dignities which were previously free,-which have 
been acquired within the last forty years, or that may henceforth be acquired, whether 
through an increase of the endowment, or in consequence of erecting the building afresh, 
or from some other like cause, even though with the authority of the Apostolic See, shall 
be carefully taken cognizance of by the said Ordinaries, as delegates as aforesaid; and 
they shall not be hindered by the faculties, or privileges of any individual in regard 
thereof; but they shall wholly revoke such rights of patronage as they [Page 267] shall 
find not to have been legitimately established on account of some most evident necessity 
of the church, or benefice, or dignity; and they shall restore benefices of this kind to their 
former state of liberty; without injury however to the incumbents thereof, and after having 
restored to the patrons whatsoever they may have given on this score; any privileges, 
constitutions, and customs, even though immemorial, notwithstanding. 
CHAPTER X.  
Judges, unto whom causes may be committed by the Apostolie See, are to be nominated 
by the Synod: all judges shall terminate causes speedily. 
Forasmuch as on account of the malicious suggestions of suitors, and at times also by 
reason of the distance of places, a knowledge of the persons to whom causes are 
committed cannot be perfectly obtained; and hence causes are sometimes referred to 
judges on the spot who are not altogether fit; the holy Synod ordains, that, in each 
provincial, or diocesan, Synod, there shall be designated certain persons who have the 
qualifications required by the constitution of Boniface VIII., which begins, Statutum, and 
who are otherwise suited thereunto; that, to them also, besides the Ordinaries of the 
places, may henceforth be committed those ecclesiastical and spiritual causes, belonging 
to the ecclesiastical court, which may have to be delegated to their districts. And if one of 
these so designated shall happen to die in the interim, the Ordinary of the place, with the 
advice of the Chapter, shall substitute another in his stead, until the next provincial or 
diocesan Synod; in such sort that each diocese shall have at least four, or even more, 
persons approved of and qualified as above, to whom causes of this nature may be 
committed by any legate, or nuncio, and even by the Apostolic See: otherwise, after the 
said designation has been made, which the bishops shall forthwith transmit to the 
Sovereign Roman Pontiff, any delegations whatsoever of other [Page 268] judges, made 
to any others but the above, shall be regarded as surreptitious. 
The holy Synod furthermore admonishes both the Ordinaries and all other judges 
whatsoever to endeavour to terminate causes in as brief a period as possible; and to meet 
in every way, either by prescribing a given term, or by some other available method, the 
artifices of lawyers, whether in delaying the trial of the suit, or any other part of the 
judicial process. 
CHAPTER XI.  
Certain leases of Ecclesiastical Property or rights are prohibited; certain other such leases 
are annulled. 
It ordinarily brings great ruin upon churches, when the property thereof is, to the 
prejudice of those who succeed, leased out to others upon the present payment of a sum of 
money. Wherefore, all leases of this kind, if made for payments in advance, shall be in no 
wise considered valid to the prejudice of those who succeed; any indult or privelege 
whatsoever notwithstanding; nor shall such leases be confirmed in the Roman court, or 
elsewhere. Neither shall it be lawful, to farm out ecclesiastical jurisdictions, or the 
faculties of nominating, or of deputing vicars in spirituals ; nor for the lessees to exercise 
the above in person or by others; and any grants to the contrary, even though made by the 
Apostolic See, shall be esteemed surreptitious. As to leases of ecclesiastiscal things, even 
though confirmed by apostolical authority, the holy Synod declares those to be invalid, 
which, having been made within the last thirty years, for a long term, or as they are 
designated in some districts, for twenty-nine, or for twice twenty-nine years, shall be 
judged by the provincial Synod, or by the deputies thereof, to have been contracted to the 
injury of the church, and contrary to the ordinances of the canons. 
[Page 269] 
CHAPTER XII.  
Tithes to be paid in full: those withholding, or hindering, the payment thereof are to be 
excommunicated: the Rectors of Poor Churches are to be piously relieved. 
Those are not to be borne who, by various artifices, endeavour to withhold the tithes 
accruing to the churches ; nor those who rashly take possession of, and apply to their own 
use, the tithes which have to be paid by others; whereas the payment of tithes is due to 
God; and they who refuse to pay them, or hinder those who give them, usurp the property 
of another. Wherefore, the holy Synod enjoins on all, of whatsoever rank and condition 
they be, to whom it belongs to pay tithes, that they henceforth pay in full the tithes, to 
which they are bound in law, to the cathedral church, or to whatsoever other churches, or 
persons, they are lawfully due. And they who either withhold them, or hinder them (from 
being paid), shall be excommunicated; nor be absolved from this crime, until after full 
restitution has been made. It further exhorts all and each, that, of their Christian charity, 
and the duty which they owe to their own pastors, they grudge not, out of the good things 
that are given them by God, to assist bountifully those bishops and parish priests who 
preside over the poorer churches; to the praise of God, and to maintain the dignity of their 
own pastors who watch for them. 
CHAPTER XIII.  
The fourth of Funeral (dues) shall be paid to the Cathedral or Parish Churches. 
The holy Synod ordains, that in whatsoever places, forty years ago, a fourth, as it is 
called, of funerals, was accustomed [Page 270] to be paid to the cathedral, or parish, 
church, but has subsequently, by virtue of whatsoever privilege, been granted to other 
monasteries, hospitals, or to any other kind of pious places; the same shall henceforth, 
with all its rights, and in the same proportion as was formerly usual, be paid to the 
cathedral or parish church; all grants, graces, privileges, even those called mare magnum, 
or any others whatsoever, to the contrary notwithstanding. 
CHAPTER XIV.  
The manner of proceeding against Clerics who keep concubines is prescribed.
 How shameful a thing, and how unworthy it is of the name of clerics who have devoted 
themselves to the service of God, to live in the filth of impurity, and unclean bondage, the 
thing itself doth testify, in the common scandal of all the faithful, and the extreme 
disgrace entailed on the clerical order. To the end, therefore, that the ministers of the 
Church may be recalled to that continency and integrity of life which becomes them; and 
that the people may hence learn to reverence them the more, that they know them to be 
more pure of life: the holy Synod forbids all clerics whatsoever to dare to keep 
concubines, or any other woman of whom any suspicion can exist, either in their own 
houses, or elsewhere, or to presume to have any intercourse with them : otherwise they 
shall be punished with the penalties imposed by the sacred canons, or by the statutes of 
the (several) churches, But if, after being admonished by their superiors, they shall not 
abstain from these women, they shall be ipso facto deprived of the third part of the fruits, 
rents, and proceeds of all their benefices whatsoever, and pensions; which third part shall 
be applied to the fabric of the church, or to some other pious place, at the discretion of the 
bishop. If, however, persisting in the same crime, with the same or some [Page 271] other 
woman, they shall not even yet have obeyed upon a second admonition, not only shall 
they thereupon forfeit all the fruits and proceeds of their benefices and pensions, which 
shall be applied to the places aforesaid, but they shall also be suspended from the 
administration of the benefices themselves, for as long a period as shall seem fit to the 
Ordinary, even as the delegate of the Apostolic See. And if, having been thus suspended, 
they nevertheless shall not put away those women, or, even if they shall have intercourse 
with them, then shall they be for ever deprived of their ecclesiastical benefices, portions, 
offices, and pensions of whatsoever kind, and be rendered thenceforth incapable and 
unworthy of any manner of honours, dignities, benefices and offices, until, after a 
manifest amendment of life, it shall seem good to their superiors, for a cause, to grant 
them a dispensation. But if, after having once put them away, they shall have dared to 
renew the interrupted connexion, or to take to themselves other scandalous women of this 
sort, they shall, in addition to the penalties aforesaid, be smitten with the sword of 
excommunication. Nor shall any appeal, or exemption, hinder or suspend the execution of 
the aforesaid; and the cognizance of all the matters above-named shall not belong to 
archdeacons, or deans, or other inferiors, but to the bishops themselves, who may proceed 
without the noise and the formalities of justice, and by the sole investigation of the truth 
of the fact. 
As regards clerics who have not ecclesiastical benefices or pensions, they shall, according 
to the quality of their crime and contumacy, and their persistance therein, be punished, by 
the bishop himself, with imprisonment, suspension from their order, inability to obtain 
benefices, or in other ways, conformably with the sacred canons. 
Bishops also, if, which God forbid, they abstain not from crime of this nature, and, upon 
being admonished by the provincial Synod, they do not amend, shall be ipso facto 
suspended; and, if they persist therein, they shall be reported by the said Synod to the 
most holy Roman Pontiff, who shall punish them according to the nature of their guilt, 
even with deprivation if need be. 
[Page 272] 
CHAPTER XV.  
The illegitimate Sons of Clerics are excluded from certain Benefices and Pensions. 
That the memory of paternal incontinency may be banished as far as possible from places 
consecrated to God, where purity and holiness are most especially beseeming; it shall not 
be lawful for the sons of clerics, not born in lawful wedlock, to hold, in those churches 
wherein their fathers have, or had, an ecclesiastical benefice, any benefice whatsoever, 
even though a different one; nor to minister in any way in the said churches; nor to have 
pensions out of the revenues of benefices which their fathers hold, or have aforetime held. 
And if a father and son shall be found, at this present time, to hold benefices in the same 
church; the son shall be compelled to resign his benefice, or to exchange it for another out 
of that church, within the space of three months, otherwise he shall be ipso jure deprived 
thereof; and any dispensation in regard of the aforesaid shall be accounted surreptitious. 
Moreover, any reciprocal resignations which shall from this time forth be made by fathers 
who are clerics in favour of their sons, that one may obtain the benefice of the other, shall 
be wholly regarded as made in fraudulent evasion of this decree, and of the ordinances of 
the canons; nor shall the collations that may have followed, by virtue of resignations of 
this kind, or of any other whatsoever made fraudulently, be of avail to the said sons of 
clerics. 
CHAPTER XVI.  
Benefices with cure shall not be converted into simple Benefices: a suitable portion of the 
fruits shall be assigned to the Vicar who exercises the cure of souls. 
The holy Synod ordains, that those Secular ecclesiastical benefices, by whatsoever name 
they may be called, which, by [Page 273] their original institution, or in any other way 
whatever, have the cure of souls, shall not henceforth be converted into a simple benefice, 
even though a suitable portion be assigned to a perpetual vicar; notwithstanding any 
graces whatsoever which have not obtained their full effect. But, as regards those 
benefices wherein, contrary to the institution or foundation thereof, the cure of souls has 
been transferred to a perpetual vicar, even though they be found to have been in this state 
from time immemorial, if a suitable portion of the fruits have not been assigned to the 
vicar of the church, by what name soever he may be designated, the same shall be 
assigned as soon as possible, and within a year at the furthest from the end of the present 
Council, at the discretion of the Ordinary; pursuant to the form of the decree made under 
Paul III., of happy memory. But if this cannot conveniently be done, or if it be not done, 
within the said term, as soon as the benefice shall be vacant, either by the resignation or 
death of the vicar, or rector, or in whatsoever way either of the above shall vacate it, it 
shall receive again the cure of souls; the name of vicarage cease; and it shall be restored 
to its ancient state. 
CHAPTER XVII.  
Bishops shall maintain their dignity; nor conduct themseIves with unworthy servility 
towards the Ministers of Kings, towards Lords, or Barons. 
The holy Synod cannot but sorely grieve at hearing that certain bishops, forgetful of their 
own estate, do in no slight manner disgrace the pontifical dignity; comporting themselves 
with an unseemly kind of servility, both in church and out of it, before the ministers of 
kings, nobles, and barons; and, as if they were inferior ministers of the altar, not only 
most unworthily give them place; but even serve them in person. Wherefore, the holy 
Synod, detesting this and the like behaviour, doth, by renewing all the sacred canons, the 
General Councils, and [Page 274] other apostolical ordinances, which relate to the 
decorum and authority of the episcopal dignity, enjoin, that henceforth bishops abstain 
from the like; charging them that, both in church and out of it, having before their eyes 
their own rank and order, they every where bear in mind that they are fathers and pastors; 
charging also others, as well princes, as all persons whatsoever, to pay them paternal 
honour and due reverence. 
CHAPTER XVIII.  
The Canons shall be exactly observed: if, at any time, a dispensation is to be granted in 
regard thereof, it shall be done with the most mature deliberation. 
As it is expedient for the public good, to relax at times the restraint of law, thereby more 
completely to meet, for the common advantage, the cases and necessities which arise; 
even so, to dispense too often with the law, and to yield to petitioners on account of 
precedent, rather than upon any certain discrimination in regard of persons and 
circumstances, is nothing else but to open a way for each one to transgress the laws. 
Wherefore, be it known to all men, that the most sacred canons are to be exactly observed 
by all, and, as far as this is possible, without distinction. But if any urgent and just reason, 
and at times a greater good, shall require that some be dispensed with; this shall be 
granted, after the cause has been taken cognizance of, and after the most mature 
deliberation, and gratuitously, by all those soever to whom that dispensation appertains; 
and any dispensation granted otherwise shall be esteemed surreptitious. 
CHAPTER XIX.  
Duelling is prohibited under the most severe penalties. 
The detestable custom of duelling, introduced by the contrivance of the devil, that by the 
bloody death of the body, he [Page 275] may accomplish the ruin of the soul, shall be 
utterly exterminated from the Christian world. Any emperor, kings, dukes, princes, 
marquises, counts, and temporal lords by whatsoever other name entitled, who shall grant 
a place within their territories for single combat between Christians, shall be thereupon 
excommunicated, and shall be understood to be deprived of jurisdiction and dominion 
over any city, castle, or place, in or at which they have permitted the duel to take place, 
which they hold of the church ; and if those places be held as a fief they shall forthwith 
escheat to their direct lords. 
As to the persons who have fought, and those who are called their seconds (sponsors), 
they shall incur the penalty of excommunication, and the confiscation of all their 
property, and of perpetual infamy, and are to be punished as homicides, according to the 
sacred canons; and if they have perished in the conflict itself, they shall be for ever 
deprived of ecclesiastical sepulture. Those also who have given counsel in the ease of a 
duel, whether for the question of right, or fact, or have in any other way whatever 
persuaded any one thereunto, as also the spectators thereof, shall be subjected to the bond 
of excommunication, and of a perpetual malediction ; any privilege soever, or evil 
custom, though immemorial, notwithstanding. 
CHAPTER XX.  
The Immunities, Liberty, and other Rights of the Church are recommended to Secular 
Princes. 
The holy Synod being desirous that ecclesiastical discipline may not only be restored 
amongst the Christian people, but that it also may be for ever preserved sound and safe 
from all manner of adverse attempts; besides those things which It has ordained touching 
ecclesiastical persons, has thought fit, that Secular princes also be admonished of their 
duty; trusting that they,--as Catholics, whom God hath willed to be the protectors [Page 
276] of holy faith and church,--will not only grant that to the church her own right be 
restored, but will also recall all their own subjects to due reverence towards the clergy, 
parish priests, and the superior orders; nor permit that their officers, or inferior 
magistrates, through any spirit of covetousness, or any heedlessness, violate that 
immunity of the church and of ecclesiastical persons, which, by the ordinance of God, and 
by the appointments of the canons has been established; but (see) that they render, 
conjointly with the princes themselves, due observance to the sacred constitutions of 
Sovereign Pontiffs and of Councils. 
It ordains, therefore, and enjoins, that the sacred canons, and all the General Councils, as 
also all other apostolic ordinances, published in favour of ecclesiastical persons, of the 
liberty of the Church, and against the violators thereof,--all which It also renews by this 
present decree,--be exactly observed by all men. And for this cause It admonishes the 
emperor, kings, republics, princes, and all and each of whatsoever state and dignity they 
be, that, the more bountifully they are adorned with temporal goods, and with power over 
others, the more religiously should they respect whatsoever is of ecclesiastical right, as 
belonging especially to God, and as being under the cover of His protection; and that they 
suffer not such to be injured by any barons, nobles, governors, or other temporal lords, 
and above all by their own immediate officers; but punish those severely, who obstruct 
her liberty, immunity, and jurisdiction; being themselves an example to them in regard of 
piety, religion, and the protection of the churches, in imitation of those most excellent and 
religious princes their predecessors, who not only defended from all injury from others, 
but, by their authority and munificence, in a special manner advanced the interests of their 
own church. Wherefore let each one herein discharge his duty carefully ; that so the 
divine worship may be devoutly celebrated, and prelates and other clerics remain, quietly 
and without hindrances, in their own residences and in the discharge of their duties, to the 
profit and edification of the people. 
[Page 277] 
CHAPTER XXI.  
In all things the authority of the Aposto1ic See shall remain untouched. 
Lastly, the holy Synod declares, that all and singular the things which, under whatsoever 
clauses and words, have been ordained in this sacred Council, in the matter of reformation 
of morals, and ecclesiastical discipline, as well under the Sovereign Pontiffs, Paul III., and 
Julius III., of happy memory, as under the most blessed Pius IV., have been so decreed, as 
that the authority of the Apostolic See both is, and is understood to be, untouched thereby 
DECREE FOR CONTINUING THE SESSION ON THE FOLLOWING DAY.
 Whereas all those things which had to be treated of in the present Session cannot, because 
of the lateness of the hour, be conveniently despatched; therefore, according as was 
resolved on by the Fathers in general congregation, the things which remain are deferred 
till tomorrow, in continuation of this same Session. 
CONTINUATION OF THE SESSION.
 On the fourth day of December. 
DECREE CONCERNING INDULGENCES.
 Whereas the power of conferring Indulgences was granted by Christ to the Church; and 
she has, even in the most ancient times, used the said power, delivered unto her of God; 
the sacred holy Synod teaches, and enjoins, that the use of Indulgences, for the Christian 
people most salutary, and approved of [Page 278] by the authority of sacred Councils, is 
to be retained in the Church; and It condemns with anathema those who either assert, that 
they are useless; or who deny that there is in the Church the power of granting them. In 
granting them, however, It desires that, in accordance with the ancient and approved 
custom in the Church, moderation be observed; lest, by excessive facility, ecclesastical 
discipline be enervated. And being desirous that the abuses which have crept therein, and 
by occasion of which this honourable name of Indulgences is blasphemed by heretics, be 
amended and corrected, It ordains generally by this decree, that all evil gains for the 
obtaining thereof,--whence a most prolific cause of abuses amongst the Christian people 
has been derived,--be wholly abolished. But as regards the other abuses which have 
proceeded from superstition, ignorance, irreverence, or from what soever other source, 
since, by reason of the manifold corruptions in the places and provinces where the said 
abuses are committed, they cannot conveniently be specially prohibited; It commands all 
bishops, diligently to collect, each in his own church, all abuses of this nature, and to 
report them in the first provincial Synod; that, after having been reviewed by the opinions 
of the other bishops also, they may forthwith be referred to the Sovereign Roman Pontiff, 
by whose authority and prudence that which may be expedient for the universal Church 
will be ordained; that this the gift of holy Indulgences may be dispensed to all the faithful, 
piously, holily, and incorruptly. 
ON CHOICE OF MEATS; ON FASTS, AND FESTIVAL DAYS.
 The holy Synod furthermore exhorts, and, by the most holy advent of our Lord and 
Saviour, conjures all pastors, that, like good soldiers, they sedulously recommend to all 
the faithful all those things which the holy Roman Church, the mother and [Page 279] 
mistress of all churches, has ordained, as also those things which, as well in this Council, 
as in the other oecumenical Councils, have been ordained, and to use all diligence that 
they be observant of all thereof, and especially of those which tend to mortify the flesh, 
such as the choice of meats, and fasts ; as also those which serve to promote piety, such as 
the devout and religious celebration of festival days; often admonishing the people to 
obey those set over them (Heb. xiii. 17), whom they who hear, shall hear God as a 
rewarder, whereas they who contemn them, shall feel God himself as an avenger. 
ON THE INDEX OF BOOKS; ON THE CATECHISM, BREVIARY, AND MISSAL.
 The sacred and holy Synod, in the second Session celebrated under our most holy lord, 
Pius IV., commissioned certain chosen Fathers to consider what ought to be done 
touching various censures, and books either suspected or pernicious, and to report thereon 
to the said holy Synod; hearing now that the finishing hand has been put to that labour by 
those Fathers, which, however, by reason of the variety and multitude of books cannot be 
distinctly and conveniently judged of by the holy Synod; It enjoins that whatsoever has 
been by them done shall be laid before the most holy Roman Pontiff, that it may be by his 
judgment and authority terminated and made public. And it commands that the same be 
done in regard of the Catechism, by the Fathers to whom that work was consigned, and as 
regards the missal and breviary. 
ON THE PLACE OF AMBASSADORS.
 The holy Synod declares, that, by the place assigned to ambassadors, as well Ecclesiastics 
as Seculars, whether in Session, procession, or in any other acts whatsoever, no prejudice 
has been created in regard of any amongst them; but that all their [Page 280] own rights 
and prerogatives, and those of their own emperor, kings, republics, and princes are 
uninjured and untouched, and continue in the same state as they were before the present 
Council. 
ON RECEIVING AND OBSERVING THE DECREES OF THE COUNCIL.
 So great has been the calamitousness of these times, and such the inveterate malice of the 
heretics, that there has been nothing ever so clear in our statement of faith, nothing so 
surely settled, which they, at the instigation of the enemy of the human race, have not 
defiled by some sort of error. For which cause the holy Synod hath made it Its especial 
care to condemn and anathematize the principal errors of the heretics of our time, and to 
deliver and teach the true and Catholic doctrine; even as It has condemned, and 
anathematized, and decreed. 
And whereas so many bishops, summoned from the various provinces of the Christian 
world, cannot be absent for so long a time without great loss to the flock entrusted to 
them, and without universal danger ; and whereas no hope remains that the heretics, after 
being so often invited, even with the public faith which they desired, and after being so 
long expected, will come hither later; and it is therefore necessary to put an end at length 
to the sacred Council: it now remains for It to admonish in the Lord all princes, as It 
hereby does, so to afford their assistance as not to permit the things which it has decreed 
to be corrupted or violated by heretics; but that they be by them and all others devoutly 
received, and faithfully observed. And should any difficulty arise in regard of receiving 
those decrees, or should anything be met with, which it does not believe, requiring 
explanation or definition, the holy Synod trusts that, besides the other remedies appointed 
in this Council, the most blessed Roman Pontiff will make it his care that, for the glory of 
God and the tranquillity of the Church, the necessities of the provinces be provided for, 
either by summoning particularly out of the provinces where the difficulties shall have 
arisen, those [Page 281] persons whom he shall deem it expedient (to employ) in treating 
of the said matters; or even by the celebration of a general Council, if he judge it 
necessary; or in such other way as shall seem to him most suitable. 
ON RECITING, IN SESSION, THE DECREES OF THE COUNCIL UNDER PAUL III. 
AND JULIUS III. 
Forasmuch as, at divers times, as well under Paul III., as under Julius III., of happy 
memory, many things have, in this sacred Council, been ordained and defined touching 
dogmas and reformation of manners; the holy Synod wills that they be now recited and 
read. 
They were recited. 
ON THE CLOSE OF THE COUNCIL, AND ON SUING FOR CONFIRMATION 
FROM OUR MOST HOLY LORD. 
Most illustrious lords and most reverend Fathers, doth it please you, that, to the praise of 
Almighty God, an end be put to this sacred oecumenical Synod? and that the confirmation 
of all and singular the things which have therein been decreed and defined, as well under 
the Roman Pontiffs, Paul III., and Julius III., of happy memory, as under our most holy 
lord Pius IV., be requested, in the name of this holy Synod, by the presidents, and the 
Legates of the Apostolic See, from the most blessed Roman Pontiff? 
They answered: It pleaseth us. 
Afterwards, the most illustrious and most reverend Cardinal Morone, the first Legate and 
President, blessing the holy Synod said: After having given thanks to God, most reverend 
Fathers, go in peace. 
They answered: Amen. 
ACCLAMATIONS OF THE FATHERS AT THE CLOSE OF THE COUNCIL.
 The Cardinal of Lorraine. To the most blessed Pius, Pope, and our lord, pontiff of the holy 
and universal Church, many years and eternal memory.

The Cardinal. To the Legates of the Apostolic Roman See, and presidents of this Synod, 
many thanks and many years. 
Answer. Many thanks: the Lord reward them.

The Cardinal. The sacred and holy oecumenical Synod of Trent: let us confess the faith 
thereof; let us ever keep the decrees thereof. 
Answer. Ever let us confess, ever keep. 
[Page 283] The Cardinal. We all thus believe; we all think the very same ; we all, 
consenting and embracing (them), subscribe. This is the faith of blessed Peter, and of the 
apostles: this is the faith of the Fathers: This is the faith of the Orthodox. 
Answer. Thus we believe; thus we think; thus we subscribe. 
The Cardinal. To these decrees adhering may we be made worthy of the mercies and 
grace of the first and great supreme priest, Jesus Christ God; our inviolate Lady, the holy 
mother of God, also interceding, and all the saints. 
Answer. So be it: so be it. Amen, Amen. 
Cardinal. Anathema to all heretics. 
Answer Anathema, anathema. 
After this, it was enjoined on all the Fathers, by the Legates and presidents, under pain of 
excommunication, that, before departing from the city of Trent, they should subscribe 
with their own hand the decrees of the Council, or approve thereof by some public 
instrument; all of whom subsequently subscribed, and they were in number CCLV; to wit, 
four legates, two cardinals, three patriarchs, twenty-five archbishops, one hundred and 
sixty-eight bishops, seven abbots, thirty-nine proctors of absent (prelates) with lawful 
commission, seven generals. 
Praise be to God.
 It agrees with the original: in faith whereof we have subscribed: 
I, Angelus MASSARELLI, bishop of Telesia, secretary of the sacred Council of Trent. 
I, Marcus Antonius PEREGRINUS, of Como, notary of the said Council. 
I, Cynthius PAMPHILUS, clerk of the diocese of Camerino, notary of the said Council. 
CONFIRMATION OF THE COUNCIL.
 We, Alexander di Farnese, cardinal-deacon of Saint Lawrence in Damaso, vice-chancellor 
of the holy Roman Church, [Page 284] do certify and attest, that, on this day, being 
Wednesday, the twenty-sixth of January, MDLXIV, in the fifth year of the pontificate of 
our most holy lord Pius IV., by the providence of God, Pope, the most reverend my lords, 
the cardinals Morone and Simonetta, lately returned from the sacred Council of Trent, 
whereat they had presided as Legates of the Apostolic See, did, in a secret consistory, 
held at St. Peter's, petition our said most holy lord as follows: 
Most blessed Father; in a decree, concerning the closing of the oecumenical Council of 
Trent, published the day before the nones of December last, it was ordained, that, through 
the presidents and Legates of your Holiness, and of the holy Apostolic See, confirmation 
should be requested from your Holiness, in the name of the said Council, of all and 
singular the things which were therein decreed and defined, as well under Paul III., and 
Julius III., of happy memory, as under your Holiness. Wherefore, we, John, Cardinal 
Morone, and Louis, Cardinal Simonetta, who were then Legates and presidents, wishing 
to execute what was appointed in that decree, do humbly petition in the name of the said 
oecumenical Council of Trent, that your Holiness would vouchsafe to confirm all and 
singular the things which have therein been decreed and defined, as well under Paul III., 
and Julius III., of happy memory, as under your Holiness. 
Upon hearing which, his Holiness, having looked at and read the tenour of the said 
decree, and having takein the advice of the most reverend lords, the cardinals, replied in 
these words : Acceding to the petition made to us, by the Legates aforesaid, in the name 
of the oecumenical Council of Trent, touching the confirmation thereof, We, with 
apostolic authority, and with the advice and assent of our venerable brethren the cardinals, 
having previously had a mature deliberation with them, do confirm all and singular the 
things which have been decreed and defined in the said Council, as well under Paul III., 
and Julius III., of happy memory, as during the time of our pontificate; and we [Page 285] 
command that the same be received and inviolably observed by all the faithful of Christ; 
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. 
So it is. 
A. Cardinal FARNESE, 
Vice-Chancellor 
BULL OF OUR MOST HOLY LORD PIUS IV., BY PROVIDENCE OF GOD, POPE, 
TOUCHING THE CONFIRMATION OF THE OECUMENICAL (AND) GENERAL 
COUNCIL OF TRENT.
 Pius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, for the perpetual memory hereof. 
Blessed be the God, and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the 
God of all comfort, who hath vouchsafed to look down upon His holy Church, agitated 
and tossed by so many storms and tempests, and, whilst it was day by day more sorely 
distressed, hath at length brought relief thereunto by a suitable and wished-for remedy. To 
extirpate very many and most pernicious heresies, to correct manners, and to restore 
ecclesiastical discipline, to procure time peace and concord of the Christiain people, an 
oecumenical and general Council had been, a long time previously, indicted by our 
predecessor, Paul III., of pious memory, and had been begun by holding several Sessions. 
Having been, by his successor, recalled to the same city, the Council, after several 
Sessions had been celebrated, could not, on account of various impediments and 
difficulties which supervened, be even then brought to a conclusion: it was, therefore, for 
a long time interrupted, not without the greatest grief on the part of all persons of piety, 
whilst the Church daily more and more implored that remedy. But we, upon having 
entered upon the government of the Apostolic See, undertook to accomplish so necessary 
and salutary a work, even as our pastoral solicitude admonished us; [Page 286] trusting in 
the Divine Mercy, and aided by the pious zeal of our most beloved son in Christ, 
Ferdinand, Emperor elect of the Romans, and by that of other Christian kings, republics, 
and princes, we have at length attained to that which we have not ceased to labour after by 
daily and nightly watchfulness, and which we have assiduously besought of the Father of 
lights. For whereas a most numerous assembly of bishops and of other distinguished 
prelates, and one worthy of an oecumenical Council, had, upon being convoked by our 
letters, and impelled also by their own piety, been gathered together from all sides out of 
the nations of Christendom, at the said city; together with whom were very many other 
persons of piety, pre-eminent for skill in sacred letters, and knowledge of divine and 
human law; the Legates of the Apostolic See presiding in the said Synod; ourselves so 
favourable to the liberty of the Council, as even to have, by letters written to our Legates, 
voluntarily left the said Council free to determine concerning matters properly reserved to 
the Apostolic See; such things as remained to be treated of, defined, and ordained, 
touching the sacraments and other matters, which seemed to be necessary for confuting 
heresies, removing abuses, and amending morals, were by the sacred and holy Synod with 
the most perfect liberty and diligence, treated of, and accurately and most deliberately 
defined, explained, and ordained, which being completed, the Council was brought to a 
close with so great unanimity on the part of all who assisted thereat, that it was plain that 
such agreement was the Lord's doing, and it was very wonderful in our eyes, and those of 
all. For which so singular a bounty, We at once appointed solemn processions in this good 
city, which were assisted at with great piety by the clergy and people; and We made it our 
care that the thanksgivings so justly due should be paid to the divine majesty; forasmuch 
as the issue of that Council has brought with it a great and well nigh assured hope that 
greater fruits will day by day be derived unto the Church from the decrees and 
constitutions thereof. 
[Page 287] And whereas the said holy Synod, in its reverence towards the Apostolic See, 
and following also in the traces of the ancient Councils, has, in a decree made thereon in 
public Session, requested of us the confirmation of all Its decrees, passed in our time and 
that of our predecessors; We, being made acquainted with the request of the said Synod, 
first by the letters of our Legates, then, upon their return, by what they diligently reported 
in the name of the Synod; after mature deliberation had thereon with our venerable 
brethren the cardinals of the holy Roman Church, and, above all, having invoked the 
assistance of the Holy Spirit; after that we had ascertained that all those decrees were 
Catholic, and useful and salutary to the Christian people, We, to the praise of Almighty 
God, with the advice and assent of our brethren aforesaid, have this day, in our secret 
consistory, confirmed by Apostolic authority all and singular those decrees, and have 
ordained that the same be received and observed by all the faithful of Christ; as also, for 
the clearer information of all men, We do, by the tenour of this letter, confirm them, and 
ordain that they be received and observed. 
And, in virtue of holy obedience, and under the penalties by the sacred canons appointed, 
and others more grievous, even those of deprivaiton, to be inflicted at our discretion, We 
do also command all and each of our venerable brethren, the patriarchs, archbishops, 
bishops, and all other prelates whatsoever of the churches, of what estate, grade, order and 
dignity soever, they may be, even though distinguished with the honour of the cardinalate, 
diligently to observe the said decrees and statutes in their own churches, cities, and 
dioceses, both in their courts of justice and elsewhere, and to cause the same to be 
inviolably observed, each by his own subjects, in so far as they are in any way concerned 
therein; silencing gainsayers, and the refractory, by means of judicial sentences, and by 
the censures also and ecclesiastical penalties contained in the said decrees; calling in also, 
if need be, the help of the secular arm. And, by the bowels of the mercy of our Lord Jesus 
Christ, We admonish and conjure our said most beloved son the emperor elect, and the 
Christian kings, republics, and princes, with that piety with which they assisted, by their 
ambassadors, at the Council, with [Page 288] the same piety and equal zeal, for the sake 
of God's honour, and the salvation of their people, in reverence also towards the Apostolic 
See, and the sacred Synod, to support, when needful, with their assistance and 
countenance, the prelates in executing and observing the decrees of the said Council ; and 
not to permit opinions adverse to the sound and salutary doctrine of the Council to be 
received by the people who are under their sway, but utterly to interdict such. 
Furthermore, in order to avoid the perversion and confusion which might arise, if each 
one were allowed, as he might think fit, to publish his own commentaries and 
interpretations on the decrees of the Council ; We, by apostolic authority, forbid all men, 
as well ecclesiastics, of whatsoever order, condition, and rank they may be, as also 
laymen, with whatsoever honor and power invested ; prelates, to wit, under pain of being 
interdicted from entering the church, and all others whomsoever they be, under pain of 
excommunication incurred by the fact, to presume, without our authority to publish, in 
any form, any commentaries, glosses, annotations, scholia, or any kind of interpretation 
whatsoever of the decrees of the said Council ; or to settle anything in regard thereof, 
under any plea whatsoever, even under pretext of greater corroboration of the decrees, or 
the more perfect execution thereof, or under any other colour whatsoever. But if anything 
therein shall seem to any one to have been expressed and ordained in an obscure manner, 
and it shall appear to stand in need on that account of an interpretation or decision, let him 
Go up to the place which the Lord hath chosen; to wit, to the Apostolic See, the mistress 
of all the faithful, whose authority the holy Synod also has so reverently acknowledged. 
For, if any difficulties and controversies shall arise in regard of the said decrees, We 
reserve them to be by Us cleared up and decided, even as the holy Synod has Itself in like 
manner decreed ; being prepared, as that Synod has justly expressed Its confidence in 
regard to Us, to provide for the necessities of all the provinces, in such manner as shall 
[Page 289] seem to Us most suitable; declaring that whatsoever may be attempted to the 
contrary in this matter, whether wittingly or unwittingly, by any one, by what authority 
soever, is, notwithstanding, null and void. And that these things may come to the 
knowledge of all men, and that no one may use the excuse of ignorance; We will and 
ordain, that, in the Vatican Basilica of the prince of the apostles, and in the Lateran 
church, at the time when the people is wont to assemble there to be present at the 
solemnization of masses, this letter be publicly read in a loud voice by certain officers of 
our court; and that, after having been read, it be affixed to the doors of those churches, 
and also to the gates of the Apostolic Chancery, and to the usual place in the Campo di 
Fiore; and be there left for some time, to be read by and to come to the knowledge of all 
men. And when removed thence, copies being, according to custom, left in those same 
places, it shall be committed to the press in our good city, that so it may be more 
conveniently made known throughout the provinces and kingdoms of the Christian name. 
And we ordain and decree, that, without any doubt, faith be given to copies thereof 
written or subscribed by the hand of a public notary, and guaranteed by the seal and 
signature of some person constituted in ecclesiastical dignity. Let no one, therefore, 
infringe this our letter of confirmation, monition, inhibition, reservation, will, mandate, 
and decree, or with rash daring go contrary thereunto. But if any one shall presume to 
attempt this, let him know that he will incur the indignation of Almighty God, and of His 
blessed Apostles, Peter and Paul. Given at Rome, at Saint Peter's, in the year of the Lord's 
Incarnation One thousand five hundred and sixty-four, on the seventh of the calends of 
February, in the fifth year of our pontificate.
